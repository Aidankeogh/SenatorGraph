LindseyGrahamSC,I will respect the outcome of that vote and will try to do my part to make sure the Republican Conference is reaching our maximum potential in a difficult environment.,6,32,43,1
LindseyGrahamSC,I expect a vote tomorrow in the Senate Republican Conference on whether we should delay leadership elections until after Georgia.  I will also be part of making that motion.,8,26,59,2
