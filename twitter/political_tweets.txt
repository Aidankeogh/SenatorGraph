SenShelby	Annette and I were very sad to learn of the passing of our close friend, Honey Alexander. Our deepest condolences go out to Lamar and his entire family. Honey will long be remembered for her charm, grace, and public service. She will be missed by all who knew her.	1	9	24	1	6290
SenShelby	The Port’s rise is attributable to everyone who has been involved in promoting its growth and the many ways it benefits Alabama. This is just the beginning.	1	7	3	0	324
SenShelby	I have long known that Alabama’s largest port could have a pivotal impact on the growth of our state. Throughout my career, I’ve focused on projects that aim to position Alabama for long-term success, and the Port has been one of those priorities.	1	6	3	0	325
SenShelby	These results are cause for celebration throughout Alabama. The impact that the Port of Mobile has already had on Alabama’s economy is remarkable. I am proud to witness this great news and believe these numbers will continue to improve.	1	4	1	0	326
SenShelby	A new study reveals the Port of Mobile’s critical impact on the entire state of Alabama – including 300,000+ jobs and $85 billion in economic value.	2	16	6	1	327
SenShelby	.@ARCgov, an integral partner in promoting workforce development in AL, awarded @WallaceState a $1.17M POWER grant. I look forward to the many benefits expected to stem from this investment. A well-trained workforce is key to fueling our state’s economy.	1	10	11	0	328
SenShelby	Grateful to the City of Enterprise and Mayor Cooper for the proclamation regarding my career in public service. I’ve had the pleasure of representing the people of Enterprise in the Senate for the last 36 years. Thank you, Enterprise, for allowing me that high honor.	5	15	19	0	5314
SenShelby	Since President Biden took office in January 2021, inflation has risen 13.5%. Democrats are clearly in over their heads and unable to bring down costs. The American people are tired of overpaying for gas, groceries, utility bills, etc. It's unaffordable and unacceptable.	37	75	135	5	3828
SenShelby	For 247 years, we have benefitted immensely from the @USNavy. Our waterways are better protected, our military is stronger, and we are combat-ready thanks to our brave sailors. Thank you for your service and for keeping watch all these years!	8	19	49	0	5315
SenShelby	In April @NOAA awarded @UofAlabama a $360M award to establish a Cooperative Institute for Research to Operations in Hydrology.

SenShelby	We have made significant progress toward a CR that is as clean as possible. But, if the Democrats insist on including permitting reform, I will oppose it. Passing a clean CR will allow us to focus on completing the FY23 appropriations process before the end of this year.	5	29	21	6	3412
SenShelby	FAA has awarded a total of $3.69 million in grant funding for four airports in Alabama. These various improvements to safety and overall functionality will help enhance opportunities for growth and economic development. Great news! @FAANews	3	41	5	3	331
SenShelby	I am pleased to hear that Alex Drueke and Andy Huynh, the two men from Alabama who were captured in Ukraine, are expected to soon return home. Relieved that they are safe and look forward to them being back on U.S. soil.	8	11	25	2	332
SenShelby	Glad to hear of the Administration's intent to nominate Travis Hill as a Member and Vice Chair of the Board of Directors at @FDICgov.

SenShelby	Pleased to see @RaytheonTech &amp; @LockheedMartin awarded $311 million to build 2,100 Javelin missiles in #Troy, Alabama. Nearly 1,800 of these missiles will replace the US draw down inventory from the Ukraine war, &amp; the remainder will support foreign allies.	1	7	4	0	333
SenShelby	It was a high honor to break ground on the U.S. Courthouse for the Northern District of Alabama this morning.

SenShelby	The Huntsville area is one of Alabama’s crown jewels, and I've worked diligently to secure the right conditions and resources for its success. Over the next few months, I'll continue to advocate for Huntsville and build upon its momentum. Thank you, again, @HuntsvilleALCOC!	1	2	5	0	335
SenShelby	Thank you, @HuntsvilleALCOC, for hosting me this morning as I delivered my final Washington update to this group of North Alabamians.

SenShelby	Enjoyed meeting with Dr. Francis Collins this afternoon about his work at the National Human Genome Research Institute. A longtime friend &amp; brilliant scientist, Dr. Collins’ impact on biomedical research &amp; the health of our nation is immeasurable. I always appreciate our visits.	3	27	22	2	6291
SenShelby	Today I met with Sen. @Adolfo_Urso, President of COPASIR, the Italian parliament’s intelligence oversight committee. We discussed the importance of NATO and our response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. I appreciate his steadfast commitment to freedom at home and abroad.	5	55	35	1	337
SenShelby	Today’s CPI report contradicts what Democrats want Americans to believe. Inflation is not under control and the economy is not back on track. Grocery prices are up 13.5% from last year, gas prices are still too high, electricity costs more, and Dems are still spending recklessly.	5	19	26	2	3829
SenShelby	Queen Elizabeth II was a loyal and steadfast public servant who led with class, wisdom, and strength. Her 70-year reign will long be remembered as one of stability. May she rest in peace.	7	10	47	1	6292

SenShelby	Particularly pleased that Huntsville has been awarded the funds to construct multiple pedestrian bridges that will soon provide greater access to businesses &amp; vital services located downtown. This project has been in the works for some time, &amp; I look forward to the final product.	3	11	12	0	340
SenShelby	The policies created in this legislation are not what Americans want, nor are they what Americans need. I am disappointed that my Senate Democratic colleagues supported this legislation knowing it fails the American people.	3	21	14	1	3830
SenShelby	This makes no sense. Right now, Congress should be focused on reducing costs and growing economic investment, not spending $80 billion to double the size and scope of the IRS and hundreds of billions of dollars to combat climate change.	5	25	21	1	5321
SenShelby	"The so-called ""Inflation Reduction Act"" will result in increased costs for hardworking Americans, further crushing families’ finances. Dems will spend hundred of billions to raise taxes &amp; swell the cost of living while Americans endure record-high inflation &amp; a declining economy."	41	291	172	15	3831
SenShelby	In an effort to unleash our own energy sources and lower infrastructure costs, my amendment to the Dems' tax &amp; spend bill would require the Secretary of @Interior to complete pending Lease by Application processes for both metallurgical and thermal coal.	8	14	23	0	5322
SenShelby	"Senate Democrats are preparing to pass legislation that will double the size of the IRS. Their plan is to squeeze out more of your hard-earned dollars in order to fund their far left agenda. The ""Inflation Reduction Act"" will only leave Americans with less money in their pockets."	55	281	198	16	3413
SenShelby	Proud to join @SenDanSullivan in the fight to overturn the Biden Administration's NEPA regulations. We should be doing everything we can to prevent costly infrastructure project delays across our states. If this rule stands, hard-working Americans will feel the repercussions.	3	4	6	2	3832
SenShelby	Today we celebrate 232 years of the U.S. Coast Guard!

Thank you, @USCG, for protecting our nation's waterways and remaining #AlwaysReady.	5	8	14	1	5323
SenShelby	Pleased to support the accession of Finland and Sweden to NATO. Longstanding friends of the U.S., these countries are robust and modernized. Their entrance will only strengthen the alliance’s interoperability, defense capability, and collective security.	6	3	19	1	341
SenShelby	The news out of Indiana today about the accident that took the lives of Congresswoman Walorski and her staffers, Emma Thomson and Zachary Potts, is unexpected and tragic. My deepest condolences are with the family and friends of the victims and the people of Indiana.	5	2	20	0	342
SenShelby	This morning I caught up with @SecAFOfficial Frank Kendall in my Washington, D.C., office. I enjoyed talking with him about the @USAirForce’s latest funding priorities and the ways we can best support our military.	1	16	12	0	343
SenShelby	Senate Democrats are under the impression that now, while we're in the middle of a recession, is the time to raise taxes. Doing so will only further burden Americans already dealing with historic inflation and a declining economy. They can't tax &amp; spend their way out of this one.	3	34	21	2	3833
SenShelby	Throughout my career, I've remained a strong advocate for our veterans. However, the PACT Act would reclassify nearly $400 billion in VA funding, allowing Dems to instead spend that on their liberal wish list. I want to support the PACT Act, but this budget gimmick must be fixed.	12	115	44	11	3414
SenShelby	The killing of al Qaeda terrorist Ayman al-Zawahiri is welcome news and long overdue. His presence in Kabul is concerning, but not unexpected after our chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. 1/2	3	17	12	2	344
SenShelby	Our economy shrank for a second straight quarter. Couple that with 40-year high inflation levels, and what are we left with? A recession. President Biden doesn't want to admit it, but you can't argue with the facts.	39	123	99	3	6293
SenShelby	Congratulations to Joe Ritch of #Huntsville, Alabama, on being nominated by the President to serve on the Tennessee Valley Authority's Board of Directors. Joe previously served in this capacity and was once Chairman of the TVA Board. His experience would serve TVA well. @TVAnews	7	13	27	0	345
SenShelby	Today I voted against the CHIPS Act because I will not support legislation that uses hard-earned taxpayer dollars to provide corporate welfare to massive, profitable companies. These companies can afford to expand on their own. They do not need subsidizing.	8	35	43	7	3415
SenShelby	Supporting Mobile and helping South Alabama reach its full potential has been a priority of mine, and I’m grateful for the area’s continued assistance and trust. I also appreciate the proclamation declaring today #RichardShelbyDay! Thanks, again, #Mobile!	2	2	8	1	346

SenShelby	Alabama is home to some of the best schools in the nation.

SenShelby	My @BankingGOP colleagues and I finally heard back from Chairman Gensler on the @SECGov's proposed climate disclosure rule. Unfortunately, the response we received was wholly inadequate. Gensler's inability to answer straightforward questions regarding this rule is unacceptable.	5	10	5	3	5324
SenShelby	I’ve long been a champion of balancing the federal budget, but not at the expense of our national defense. Senator Braun’s proposal, while well-intentioned, essentially follows the Biden Administration’s plans to cut defense spending over the next decade. 1/2	5	12	9	1	5325

SenShelby	Inflation hit 9.1% today – another record high. This is devastating news for millions of hard-working Americans. The Biden Administration remains remiss in getting inflation under control. Passing another massive tax-and-spend bill would be a mistake we cannot afford.	6	36	11	3	3834

SenShelby	Today, @SCOTUS reversed its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which I have long-believed was unconstitutional. This is welcome news. It is our moral and ethical duty to protect the dignity of human life, particularly when it comes to the unborn.	7	136	19	1	3416

SenShelby	11 of my Senate colleagues &amp; I sent a letter to @CMSGov @BrooksLaSureCMS to encourage CMS to appeal a recent District Court ruling &amp; continue the Low Wage Index Hospital Policy. If not, the flawed AWI methodology could eventually cause hospitals to close.	10	34	30	1	5327
SenShelby	The @SECGov's proposed climate disclosure rule is inappropriate and unnecessary. I joined my @BankingGOP colleagues in warning Chairman Gensler about the significant cost and burden that this rule would have on consumers, workers, and businesses.	4	13	5	1	5328

lisamurkowski	There's no question this administration &amp; the nation need to pay greater attention to the Arctic.

SenDanSullivan	April 2020 – Saudis heed President Trump/GOP Senators’ demand to stabilize oil prices. Oct 2022 – Saudis/#OPEC ignore President Biden's call to stabilize prices. Why the difference? In 2020, America was energy dominant and negotiating from a position of strength.	10	18	21	3	434
SenDanSullivan	When oil prices rose, the Biden Admin didn’t say let’s produce more in America. They went around the world to the Saudis, to the Venezuelans, even the Iranians, begging them to produce more energy. American energy is American strength, and they are unilaterally surrendering it.	47	74	122	9	435
SenDanSullivan	This is national security suicide. @POTUS shuts down energy production in America—particularly in Alaska—then goes on bended knee to dictators in countries like Iran, Saudi Arabia &amp; Venezuela, begging them to produce more energy. Does anyone in America think this makes sense?	59	124	155	3	436

SenDanSullivan	I can’t say I’m surprised, unfortunately. The Biden administration has shown a remarkable hostility toward Alaska Natives—their voices, interests and opportunities. These are some of the poorest communities, yet also some of the most patriotic Americans.	2	6	5	2	3873
SenDanSullivan	Tribes, municipal/borough govts, the state, &amp; everyday Alaskans are doing everything they can to make these communities whole &amp; safe for long winter season.No excuse for @FEMA, Biden administration not to be doing the same by expeditiously approving our request. #TyphoonMerbok	1	2	4	0	3874
SenDanSullivan	Alaskans face uniquely dire circumstances—Freeze-up is just weeks away, leaving a VERY narrow window to recover. Ability to rebuild homes/foundations, move earth &amp; fix infrastructure effectively ends when winter arrives. A quick infusion of cash is vital. #TyphoonMerbok	3	2	6	0	3875
SenDanSullivan	✅ @FEMA will cover 100% of the costs, for one month, for those recovering from #HurricaneFiona in Puerto Rico. I support that. ❌ FEMA has *not* offered this same agreement for Alaskans recovering from #TyphoonMerbok—one of the largest storms in our state’s history. Why? 🧵	16	19	32	2	3876
SenDanSullivan	Thank you @Heather_Reams &amp; @CRESenergy for being such great partners in our efforts to unleash American energy and once again make America energy independent!#NationalCleanEnergyWeek #NCEW22	4	5	6	1	441
SenDanSullivan	Julie and I wish joy and peace for Alaska and the world’s Jewish community gathering to ring in a new year in the Jewish calendar. Shanah Tovah! #RoshHashanah	7	12	32	0	442
SenDanSullivan	The brave protesters in #Iran deserve our full support. What's going on there is a testament to the indomitable human spirit and desire for freedom in every human heart.#IranProtests2022	175	72	317	21	443
SenDanSullivan	@GovDunleavy I reiterate the arguments I recently made to the @DHSGov Secretary and @FEMA_Deanne—that if other communities that have been impacted by natural disasters, like Puerto Rico, get 100 percent federal reimbursement, then so should Alaska.	1	9	6	0	444
SenDanSullivan	I appreciate the quick response from the Biden Administration approving @GovDunleavy's request for a Major Disaster declaration to support Alaska’s recovery from the impacts of #TyphoonMerbok on Alaska families, homes, businesses, schools, and infrastructure.	6	7	16	1	445
SenDanSullivan	This effort is ultimately about strategic competition with China. The Mekong is like the South China Sea of mainland Southeast Asia. The #CCP wants to own it. America must be an active participant in solutions for the region if we want to stop them.	9	27	25	2	446
SenDanSullivan	We are all also thinking about Puerto Rico, recovering from #HurricaneFiona. As a matter of fairness, if @FEMA agrees to cover 100% of cost-share for Puerto Rico, the agency needs to do the same for Alaska. I delivered that message directly to @DHSgov secretary last night.	4	10	8	1	447
SenDanSullivan	Through the devastation of #TyphoonMerbok, we have seen the best of Alaskans—resiliency, preparedness, and looking out for one another. Alaskans are tough, but every now and then, we're going to need federal help. That time is now.	2	6	7	1	3877
SenDanSullivan	NEW: The Alaska delegation sent a letter to @POTUS urging him to quickly approve @GovDunleavy’s request for a federal disaster declaration following #TyphoonMerbok, a historic storm that  devastated homes, businesses &amp; infrastructure across 1,000 miles of Alaska’s coastline. 👇	11	12	25	2	448

SenatorSinema	Sign up to volunteer with St. Mary’s (or any organization of your choice!) to ensure no Arizona family goes hungry this Thanksgiving.	5	10	18	2	452
SenatorSinema	Arizona nonprofits like @StMarysFoodBank do incredible work addressing food insecurity in communities throughout our state. Especially at a time of record inflation and unaffordable groceries, they need our help feeding families.	8	28	37	0	453
SenatorSinema	My thoughts are with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents injured, their families, and the loved ones of the agent tragically killed in today’s attack in Puerto Rico. We owe it to our agents and their families to do more to secure the border.	28	82	235	11	454
SenatorSinema	No one should be treated differently because of who they are or who they love. Our bill – the Respect for Marriage Act – enshrines marriage equality in federal law and protects the right for individuals to marry who they love.	13	71	101	6	3426

Through bipartisan collaboration, we crafted commonsense language that respects religious liberties while upholding our view that marriage embodies the highest ideals of love, devotion, and family.	25	118	204	11	5345
SenatorSinema	Our work is not done. As a body, we must resolve to do the right thing, continue this mission, and keep working together to deliver lasting results.Our country deserves it, the American people deserve it, and the stakes are too high to stop our progress now.	10	149	69	15	3878
SenatorSinema	The bipartisan support we’ve garnered in the Senate proves this issue isn’t a matter of one party being right and the other being wrong.It’s bigger than angry tweets and bombastic fundraising emails.	11	46	90	18	5346
SenatorSinema	Not every American agrees on marriage - or lots of other issues. That’s ok.Honest disagreements don’t make us any less decent or honorable, especially if we see disagreement as an opportunity to learn and grow.	29	745	256	1046	3879
SenatorSinema	This summer, Arizonans and Americans across the country were confused and scared following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.	7	12	42	4	3427
SenatorSinema	Whether at home in Arizona or here in the United States Senate, in order to deliver real results to the Americans we serve, we need to work together.	4	11	49	4	456
SenatorSinema	Together, with broad, bipartisan support, the Senate will provide certainty to millions of Americans in loving marriages and enshrine into law the basic protections afforded all Americans while respecting our country’s critical principle of religious liberty.	7	18	72	7	3880

SenFeinstein	It’s been a pleasure to watch more and more women walk the halls of the Senate. We went from two women senators to 24 today – and I know that number will keep climbing. We have a woman vice president and a woman presidential candidate who won the popular vote.	29	17	305	5	5380

MichaelBennet	My opponent said “I don’t think we need any more [gun] laws on our books.” Colorado has endured too many avoidable tragedies from gun violence, starting with the Columbine shooting that happened just before my eldest daughter, Caroline, was born.	21	5	58	1	690
MichaelBennet	Joe O’Dea will take us back the failed policies of our past. He wants to extend the Trump tax giveaways for the ultra wealthy and big corporations. I’m pushing to give working Americans a tax cut.	210	37	411	0	4005
MichaelBennet	My opponent is lying. I’ve written 101 bills that became law - 82 of those with bipartisan support throughout my time in the Senate, including the expanded Child Tax Credit which cut childhood poverty almost in half last year.	4573	325	12078	123	5393
MichaelBennet	I will always vote to protect a woman's right to choose, but if Republicans take control of the Senate they could try and pass a nationwide abortion ban. We can't let that happen.	39	13	99	3	4006
MichaelBennet	My friend @CoryBooker joined me in Idaho Springs, Golden, and Denver yesterday to talk about ending childhood poverty across America and building an economy that works for everyone. Thank you for coming to Colorado, Cory!	30	18	118	1	691
MichaelBennet	Colorado's public lands are central to our state's economy and identity. I've helped protect over 50,000 acres already this year and I'm still working to pass the CORE Act to protect even more public land in Colorado.	35	24	138	4	692

MichaelBennet	I want Colorado to be the best state for veterans. That's why I helped pass the PACT Act to expand access to health care for veterans exposed to toxic chemicals and why I'm working to expand access to mental health services and reduce veteran homelessness.	57	36	198	3	693
MichaelBennet	Joe O’Dea says he doesn’t like a single thing about the bill I helped pass to lower prescription drug costs for seniors. He’ll put Big Pharma, Mitch McConnell, and his party ahead of Colorado’s seniors. #cosen #copolitics	113	15	204	2	694
MichaelBennet	My opponent says he supports energy independence, but he opposes the Inflation Reduction Act which I fought to pass to boost our clean energy industry, and will help Coloradans save up to $1,000/year on energy. #cosen #copolitics	42	27	115	3	3463
MichaelBennet	My opponent wants to extend the Trump tax cuts that blew a $2 trillion hole in the deficit and disproportionately went to the wealthiest Americans. I want to repeal them and invest in hardworking Coloradans.	83	19	181	4	4007
MichaelBennet	My opponent said there's not a single thing he likes about the Inflation Reduction Act, the bill I made sure includes funding to fight drought and create millions of good-paying jobs in clean energy.	72	15	157	3	3464
MichaelBennet	My opponent voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020, and says he’d vote for him in 2024. I voted to impeach Trump twice because he’s a threat to our democracy.	43	15	125	3	6337
MichaelBennet	There's a clear choice for Colorado in this race. We can build an economy that works for everyone or elect Mitch McConnell’s “perfect candidate” who will take us back to the failed policies of our past.Tune in at 7 pm for tonight’s #cosen debate:	16	3	42	0	695

Even some of her most loyal progressive allies were begging her to ditch the ACA in the name of political expediency.	356	5	3700	1	5410
ChrisMurphyCT	2/ Many rank-and-file Democrats were in a panic, and they lined up at the microphone to tell Pelosi that it was time for us to give up on the Affordable Care Act. Or chop it up into little pieces - as some in the White House were suggesting.	350	4	3657	2	3471

ChrisMurphyCT	Warnock needs to make decisions on staffing and ad buys this week. If you haven’t given yet, today is the day. If you’ve already donated, can you do one more?It matters.	687	88	1577	26	5411
ChrisMurphyCT	I don't understand this decision. CFIUS is designed to review transactions like this.We need to ask: Why did the Saudis partner with Musk on this purchase? Why didn't they take their $$ out like other owners? What access do they have to data? What say do they have on content?	882	138	2715	24	4020

ChrisMurphyCT	4/ We also must stop supplying the cartels with U.S. weapons. We should dedicate specific funding to target the guns the cartels buy in the U.S. and traffic across the border. Mexico - a country that has no retail guns stores - is awash in American guns. This needs to stop.	56	9	343	1	759
ChrisMurphyCT	2/ Almost all the fentanyl coming from Mexico arrives at our checkpoints (not crossings between checkpoints). We are dramatically increasing the number of vehicles we inspect at our ports of entry - from 16% to 80%. That will catch a lot of product.	45	7	268	4	760
ChrisMurphyCT	Now that the election is over, it's time to write a federal budget before Dec. 16.As Chairman of the Homeland Security Appropriations Sub-Committee, my main focus will be supersizing the effort to stop the flow of fentanyl into the U.S.1/ Let me tell you how:	232	58	1506	7	761

ChrisCoons	I’m glad peace talks between the Ethiopian government and the TPLF are underway. It’s vital for Ethiopia’s future for both sides to meaningfully engage in these talks and find a peaceful resolution to this conflict.	410	356	409	51	857
ChrisCoons	Annie and I met Loretta in the 80s, and over the next thirty years, my wife and I admired and, like so many others, were blessed to benefit from her friendship, her advice, and her big heart. In politics and in the community, what a leader she was—and what a friend.	1	1	4	0	6367
ChrisCoons	Loretta Walsh had an incredible heart for service. She never stopped caring for others, giving to others, fighting for others. With decades of service on the City Council and years as the chair of Finance, she kept fighting for the people of Wilmington.	1	1	11	0	858

ChrisCoons	30 years ago, polio was paralyzing 1,000 children each day. Because of investments from the US &amp; the tireless efforts of health workers, community leaders, and global partners, polio cases dropped 99.9% worldwide.

SenatorTimScott	Just when inflation is hurting family budgets and we are entering into a recession, the Biden Admin is making it harder for Americans to bridge the gap by eliminating millions of jobs and side hustles.	58	74	206	9	4092
SenatorTimScott	There is no reason for the United States to appease any dictator. We have the capability to produce our own oil—we must act now.	817	1767	5586	113	908
SenatorTimScott	Today is National Farmer’s Day! The hard work and dedication of farmers and ranchers throughout South Carolina and our great nation are vital to our flourishing country.  We appreciate farmers and ranchers, not only today, but every day!	40	27	228	1	909
SenatorTimScott	Earlier this year, I introduced the Inflation Prevention Act—the only real piece of legislation to fight inflation. Americans deserve better than this forced struggle.	51	197	512	9	4093
SenatorTimScott	Knowledge is power. In an increasingly complicated financial ecosystem, financial education should be accessible so that all Americans feel prepared to take charge of their economic future. Glad to see that starting right here in Charleston, SC!	4	21	59	2	910

SenatorTimScott	October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. 1 in 8 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in the US. This disease has affected the lives of too many of our loved ones-- we must fight to find a cure!	20	33	139	1	915
kloeffler	After 2yrs of record border crossings - including human/drug traffickers &amp; terrorists on the FBI most wanted list - we’re finally going to get the answers we deserve. This is why elections matter.	20	15	105	1	5471
kloeffler	Dems demand investigations into botched Taylor Swift ticket sales and parody accounts on Twitter. But they’re SILENT on FTX defrauding investors out of billions and funneling millions to Dem candidates.They are destroying America’s trust in our basic institutions.	178	79	698	11	916
kloeffler	Republicans lost two Senate seats in 2021 because more than 330,000 Republicans who voted in the 2020 election skipped the runoff. We can’t let it happen again. We can only win when we show up and vote for American values!	123	74	710	8	4096

kloeffler	So the “voter mobilization” group founded by Stacey and run by Warnock is now refusing to disclose where its money came from. This is why I called for an investigation. The American people deserve to know who’s involved in our elections - whether it’s FTX or Mark Zuckerberg.	114	49	277	3	4097
kloeffler	2 ½ years after the start of the pandemic, 37 Senate Democrats (including Georgia’s) voted THIS WEEK to extend the federal COVID emergency - and their federal powers.This is not about preserving public health. They only want to preserve public CONTROL.	65	17	270	2	917
kloeffler	You could vote against Warnock for trying to evict low-income residents and refusing to address it....Or because he doesn’t offer his umbrella to his young staffer in the pouring rain.His slick Hollywood ads don’t change what we see in real life: he’s wrong for Georgia.	1268	442	3362	89	918

kloeffler	Georgia has another chance to bring balance to Washington. We just elected Republicans to every constitutional office, and majorities in the State House and Senate. Now we can restore conservative representation in the US Senate for the next 6 years.	23	9	100	0	921
kloeffler	What a morning with more than 500 students from across Georgia - who, through @GeorgiaCivics, are learning about democracy and how to make a difference. So inspired by these young leaders - and the promise they represent for our great state and nation! 🇺🇸	7	9	51	0	922
kloeffler	What the media won’t tell you: Raphael Warncok is the ONLY incumbent US Senator who didn’t win outright on Election Night. He had a fundraising advantage of at least $78M.That’s a testament to the strength of @HerschelWalker - and Georgia’s conservative movement.	2001	964	10090	107	923
kloeffler	China is funding Russia’s war in Ukraine, helping North Korea, oppressing Taiwan, and abusing human rights.We shouldn’t partner with China on climate change - we should stand up to the CCP and its assault on democracy.	29	12	138	0	924
kloeffler	GA ballots cast: 4MTime to count: 24 hrs NV ballots cast: 1MTime to count: 5 days The disparity in how votes are securely counted is undemocratic. Election reform like GA’s should be a top priority for states whose actions are causing citizens to lose faith in elections.	139	58	771	7	925
kloeffler	Raphael Warnock evicted families from his apartment complex for owing as little as $25.88 Now he won’t answer for it.  The “reverend pastor” bit is wearing thin. He doesn’t care for his own flock – what makes you think he cares about the rest of GA?	236	95	534	11	5473

kloeffler	"Quick fact for the liberal pundits: Georgia's Republican State School Superintendent received the most votes on the 2022 ballot. Voters weren't motivated by ""threats to democracy."" They came out to ensure our next generation has a great education to pursue the American Dream."	28	18	141	0	928
kloeffler	Georgia is a RED state flooded by blue money. It’s up to us to defend Georgia values - and to reject the Democrat dark money, fire Warnock, and elect @HerschelWalker as our U.S. Senator this December!	80	26	304	1	929
kloeffler	I’ve said from the start that Warnock is a radical liberal. Now his voting record proves it.  It’s why, despite outraising Herschel by $78M and attacking him with every lie in the book, he only got 35,000 more votes.	88	59	446	4	6382
kloeffler	Good morning, Georgia – it’s a great day for four more years of Governor @BrianKempGA!  Congratulations to Brian, Marty, and the girls – and the ENTIRE slate of Republicans who swept our state offices! God Bless Georgia 🇺🇸	27	27	414	2	930
kloeffler	Over the last two years I’ve met thousands of Georgians at roundtables, registration drives, and community events.  We share the values of freedom, opportunity, and the American Dream - and we believe that Georgia is a red state. Today, we’re going to prove it to the nation.	5	7	78	0	931

maziehirono	The Republican economic agenda? Help the rich get richer, while doing nothing to lower your costs.Make your voice heard today.	52	49	212	6	4113
maziehirono	Republicans blocked lowering prescription drug prices for people of all ages.Now they want to repeal provisions Democrats passed that lowers drug costs for seniors with Medicare.Lowering your health care costs has not, and will not ever be a priority for Republicans.	94	49	238	6	4114
maziehirono	If you’re wondering if the Republicans' economic plan looks familiarIt’s because it’s “trickle-down economics” repackaged with a new bow.That didn’t help families 40 years ago, and it won’t help them today.	97	83	333	8	4115
maziehirono	The pandemic impacted families hard, especially families of color.The American Rescue Plan provided over 200,000 child care programs fundingWhich helped 9.5 million children across the nation and saved 1 million child care jobs.Democrats did that.	63	53	185	5	4116
maziehirono	Republicans are doing everything possible to block @POTUS's student loan debt relief—which will help millions of families across the country.Meanwhile, they want to lower taxes for the richest Americans and largest corporations.Remember this next week.	86	56	229	5	4117

maziehirono	Republicans have zero plans to lower inflation.In fact, instead of working with Democrats to actually lower your everyday costsThey will give massive tax cuts to the biggest corporations and richest Americans—which will make inflation worse.	50	52	189	6	4119
maziehirono	The American Rescue Plan was a critical lifeline for working families with children.The child care funding included in the ARP helped up to 9.5 million children across the nation and 30,200 children in Hawaii.Democrats did that.	71	38	226	2	1002
maziehirono	I’m getting really sick and tired of Republicans blaming Democrats for inflation when they have voted against every single effort by Democrats to lower costs for working families in America.The word “hypocrisy” hardly suffices.	565	1025	1711	64	1003
maziehirono	SCOTUS's Dobbs decision sowed chaos and confusion even in states like Hawaii where abortion remains legal.This report details the devastating consequences of abortion bans, especially for women of color, and the GOP's push to outlaw abortion nationwide.	35	10	74	1	1004

maziehirono	At least 15 states have banned nearly all abortion services.That's millions of people who've had their fundamental right to bodily autonomy and reproductive care stolen from them.We need at least two more pro-choice Democrats in the Senate to stop Republicans’ cruel efforts.	57	37	221	1	4134

SenJoniErnst	🧵U.S. currently has approx. 3,000 servicemembers stationed in Saudi Arabia. While Iran prepares for an attack on our partners, leading Dems are advocating for removing key air &amp; missile defense units, risking the lives of U.S. citizens &amp; our troops alike.	109	60	172	14	1243

JohnKennedyLA	We say a dog is man’s best friend for a reason, &amp; fighting animal cruelty is simply the right thing to do. Animal Wellness Action works hard to prevent animal cruelty, &amp; it’s an honor to receive their endorsement for my re-election to the U.S. Senate.	11	9	41	0	5642
JohnKennedyLA	When it comes to making medicines more affordable for working Louisianians, the patients come first. I introduced a bill to reduce costs by holding pharmacy middlemen accountable by mandating that they pass savings on to patients.	7	13	30	0	4380
JohnKennedyLA	Louisianians need access to more affordable generic medications. I helped pass a law to lower prescription costs by increasing competition among generic drug manufacturers—and it saves taxpayers money at the same time.	6	10	30	0	4381

JohnKennedyLA	President Biden’s policies have tainted, almost defiled, the American dream. Under President Biden’s policies, it’s harder than ever to get ahead in our country, and it’s easier than ever to do nothing.	11	15	70	1	4382
JohnKennedyLA	The majority of Americans believe that if you put the Biden Administration in charge of the Sahara Desert, it would quickly run out of sand.	73	70	246	1	4383
JohnKennedyLA	Louisianians can count on me to continue to be their voice in DC. Biden and his friends need to understand how much their woke agenda is beating up on hardworking Americans, and I’m going to make sure they hear it from me—on behalf of Louisiana families.	9	18	32	0	1359
JohnKennedyLA	When the scariest part of Halloween is the cost of candy, we have a serious problem on our hands. Candy is up 13.1% - the largest yearly jump in candy prices the CPI has ever recorded. Biden’s inflation is emptying Americans' pocketbooks in every way.	11	23	47	2	4384
JohnKennedyLA	It was great to be back in Louisiana’s Bayou Country tonight with a packed house full of friends from both Lafourche and Terrebonne Parish. I look forward to continuing to work for them and every Louisianian when I’m re-elected on November 8th!	8	6	25	0	1360

JohnKennedyLA	With inflation causing interest rates to reach a 16-year high, more than double from a year ago, the number of first time home buyers will continue to shrink. It has simply become unaffordable to buy a first home for many Americans.	6	14	25	2	4386
JohnKennedyLA	The cost of natural gas bills has increased 33.1% compared to one year ago. Hard-working families may have to decide between warming their homes or feeding their families if we don’t stop Biden’s reckless spending agenda.	13	14	38	0	6544

SenAngusKing	In just a few years, the Arctic could be nearly ice-free in the summers - bringing both new opportunities for trade and threats from adversaries like Russia.

SenAngusKing	Our China Grand Strategy Commission wouldn't just create a report that sits on a shelf. Much like the @CyberSolarium, it would implement real action to secure America's 21st century success. I'm excited by the bipartisan support the idea is receiving, and hope we can get it done.	2	12	24	2	1382
SenAngusKing	America's long-term success relies on our ability to understand and address the growing challenges posed by China. That's why @JohnCornyn, @TimKaine, and I are proposing a bipartisan China commission that can shape the nation's response to these threats.	23	45	101	4	1383

SenAngusKing	In their baseless attack on the Maine lobster industry, @SeafoodWatch ignored concrete scientific evidence in favor of conjecture, guesswork, and assumptions. My full thoughts in @TIME on the real facts missed by the California activists:	24	6	74	3	1393
SenAngusKing	With ZERO right whale deaths attributed to Maine lobster gear, there is simply no substantial evidence the industry poses a significant threat. @SeafoodWatch’s ‘guilty until proven innocent’ campaign is putting thousands of Maine businesses at risk and I’m calling them out.	33	20	117	4	1394

SenAngusKing	Maine's lobster industry isn't some big corporation – it's thousands of individual families, small businesses, and towns who rely on the catch. By red-listing lobster without any real evidence, @SeafoodWatch has put the livelihoods of all these people at risk. That's not science.	61	15	177	9	1398
SenAngusKing	Ukraine’s recent counteroffensive is promising, but we must be on guard for retaliation from a desperate and ruthless Putin. On @Morning_Joe we discussed the dictator's potential next steps and how America can continue to support Ukraine's fight for freedom.	6	11	54	1	1399

SenAngusKing	Twenty-one years ago, on September 11th, 2001, a heinous act of political violence took the lives of nearly 3,000 Americans.

SenAngusKing	Maine's senior veterans can use VA benefits for nursing homes, but not assisted living – a distinction that makes no sense for veterans or taxpayers. Our bipartisan bill will test VA-backed assisted living programs to help servicemembers age with dignity.	5	4	36	1	1423
SenAngusKing	Since 1790, the @USCG has protected our nation's shores and kept our sailors safe. It was great to join their early birthday celebration today to thank them for all they do and discuss how we can support their work for the next 232 years.	4	7	46	1	5651

SenAngusKing	Many of you know my love for Instagram, where I share unfiltered thoughts and occasionally-filtered photos of sunsets. Great to talk with @NoahPransky about how I use the platform to update my followers on life in Maine and activity in Washington.	17	7	73	0	1435
SenAngusKing	Protecting America’s cyberspace takes more than just strong defenses – it requires international alliances. Nate Fick of Maine is nominated for a key @StateDept position on global cyber collaboration, and I look forward to working with him to strengthen worldwide cybersecurity.	11	2	31	0	1436
SenAngusKing	The epidemic is inflicting a devastating toll on Maine communities – taking hundreds of loved ones this year alone. We must continue to confront the crisis with urgency and empathy, and I thank everyone for coming together to share their lessons learned at the summit.	3	3	15	0	1437
SenAngusKing	Maine people don't back down during hard times – they come together to take on any and every challenge. That's what we did at @GovJanetMills' Opioid Response Summit, where I joined people from across the state to discuss solutions to the opioid epidemic.	6	46	23	0	1438
SenAngusKing	With all the challenges facing Maine families, it’s encouraging to see we’ve now recovered virtually all the jobs lost in the pandemic - with more private sector jobs than any time in history. There’s still work to be done, but this is important progress.	7	68	33	0	1439
SenAngusKing	Wishing a happy Independence Day to everyone across Maine and the country. It’s always a privilege to join the Bath parade to celebrate the Fourth of July, our freedom, and all those who have made sacrifices for our nation.	6	15	78	5	67
SenAngusKing	By overturning Roe v. Wade, this Supreme Court has erased nearly half a century of precedent upon precedent through a dangerous, blatantly political ruling that will rob millions of women the right to make decisions about their own health, safety, and lives. My full statement:	1875	260	12252	41	3548
SenAngusKing	For too long, communities across our country have felt the devastation and heartbreak of America’s gun violence. Today the Senate took the most significant step in decades to confront these tragedies and protect our people from the scourge of gun violence. My full thoughts:	25	21	137	5	1440
SenAngusKing	The American people’s faith in free and fair elections – without foreign interference – is the foundation of our democracy. By requiring regular, public reports on our elections’ security and integrity from @US_CYBERCOM, we can strengthen this core trust.	18	7	81	0	4394
SenAngusKing	Bath-built ships are the backbone of our Navy and an important economic driver for our state. This year’s NDAA includes a multi-year contract for up to 15 ships that Bath can compete to build – strengthening the yard and our national security.	8	8	37	1	3549
SenAngusKing	On this #Juneteenth, we celebrate freedom, honor those who have fought to extend America’s promise to all our citizens, and recommit to advancing their mission. We must reflect on the progress our nation has made, and the work ahead to deliver true equality and justice for all.	10	14	86	1	1441
senatorcollins	In Waterville today, we celebrated the completion of a transformational project to continue the revitalization of downtown, create jobs, and bring the community together.  I was delighted to secure funding to help move this remarkable project forward.	6	21	24	1	1442
senatorcollins	Providing this security for families is the right thing to do, and I will continue to push for our bill to pass Congress so that it can be signed into law.	7	17	57	0	5655
senatorcollins	Tonight, the Senate advanced important legislation that will protect Americans in same-sex and interracial marriages. I was proud to join @SenatorBaldwin in leading this bill to remove the cloud of uncertainty for couples and help prevent discrimination.	24	92	345	11	4395
senatorcollins	I am horrified by this vicious attack on Paul Pelosi at his home.  My prayers are with him, Speaker Pelosi, and their family.	80	1005	1468	72	6549
senatorcollins	A state-of-the-art lab at @SaintJosephsME will train nursing students using life-like manikins and simulated medications. I will continue to strongly support the college’s Center for Nursing Innovation to prepare Maine’s next generation of medical professionals.	5	53	24	0	1443
senatorcollins	Maine wild blueberries are delicious, and new research confirms their health benefits as well!  Seniors who added this superfood to their diets demonstrated increased mental processing speeds.  This is just one more reason to enjoy Maine wild blueberries.	17	83	67	7	1444
senatorcollins	ACAP’s Hope and Prosperity Resource Center in Presque Isle helps individuals and families achieve brighter futures. I spoke with staff about plans to add supportive housing for those experiencing homelessness and presented a U.S. flag in honor of ACAP’s 50th anniversary.	6	31	24	2	1445
senatorcollins	By a vote of 14-1, @SenateRules took a significant step forward in advancing a bill @Sen_JoeManchin &amp; I led to make sensible, much-needed reforms to the Electoral Count Act of 1887. Our bill—cosponsored by 11 Rs and 11 Ds—would correct the flaws in this archaic, ambiguous law.	88	114	664	13	3550
senatorcollins	It was powerful to hear the firsthand accounts of Ukrainian women who are serving on the front lines.  I am committed to ensuring they have the tools they need to defend their sovereignty, reclaim their territory, and pressure Putin to bring an end to his terrible war.	13	87	60	8	4396
senatorcollins	In July, @Sen_JoeManchin &amp; I introduced a bill to reform the Electoral Count Act of 1887. Bipartisan support continues to grow, &amp; it’s now co-sponsored by 10 Republicans &amp; 10 Democrats. We will keep working to advance our bill to correct the flaws in this archaic &amp; ambiguous law.	48	139	360	21	4397
senatorcollins	Great news for Washington County!  A $33 million grant will rehabilitate a nearly 70-mile stretch of Route 1 between Machias and Calais.  By adding wider shoulders, rumble strips, and other safety measures, this new segment of road will reduce crashes.	6	50	17	3	209
senatorcollins	When tragedies or disasters strike, law enforcement, firefighters &amp; EMTs rush into danger to save lives. In Portland yesterday, Bishop Deeley led the annual Blue Mass to honor these heroes. May God bless our first responders who put their lives on the line to keep us safe.	10	24	31	2	1446
senatorcollins	This is just some of the evidence Monterey Bay’s Seafood Watch ignored by adding Maine lobster to its “Red List.” The Maine Delegation and Governor Mills are urging retailers and restaurants to consider the overwhelming proof for themselves and continue to sell Maine lobster.	10	10	27	1	1447
senatorcollins	🦞 Right whale deaths or serious injuries have never been attributed to Maine lobster gear🦞 Maine lobstermen have removed an estimated 30,000 miles of line from the ocean🦞 There has not been a known right whale entanglement with Maine lobster gear since 2004	20	65	71	4	1448
senatorcollins	As a leader of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, I strongly advocated for this highly competitive grant. More than 260 applicants requested $26 billion, and $1.5 billion was awarded in funding this year.  Maine received two of these grants.	3	19	8	0	1449
senatorcollins	A $44.1 million grant for Presque Isle will help complete a bypass to divert large trucks from Main Street, making it easier and safer for residents to visit downtown businesses.	4	36	15	3	210
senatorcollins	On the evening of that terrible day 21 years ago, Senators gathered on the steps of the U.S. Capitol and sang, “God Bless America.” The emotions of shock, anger, and grief were joined by unity, patriotism, and resolve.  That moment remains one of my most enduring memories.	18	77	83	6	1450
senatorcollins	For 70 years, Queen Elizabeth II has been a source of strength &amp; stability for one of America’s greatest allies. Her historic reign was defined by her dignity, character, &amp; devotion to duty. She will be deeply missed, but her faithful service &amp; leadership will be long remembered.	13	25	108	4	1451
senatorcollins	A $150 million investment at LP Houlton is securing and creating good-paying jobs in Aroostook County.  At the grand opening, we celebrated an expansion that will allow the mill to manufacture enough siding for 100,000 homes annually and increase demand for wood by 30%.	6	39	19	0	1452
senatorcollins	1 in 10 drug overdose deaths in our state last year occurred among Mainers 60 &amp; older. I joined @SenatorCardin in introducing a bill to strengthen opioid treatment for seniors. Addressing this epidemic that is harming people of all ages requires an all-of-the-above approach.	9	200	23	3	4398
senatorcollins	Thanks to a group of committed Mainers, the Katahdin region is becoming an even better place to start a business &amp; raise a family. I spoke with leaders of @OurKatahdin &amp; Mike Michaud, who are redeveloping the former Millinocket &amp; East Millinocket mills to bring new jobs.	7	88	21	3	4399
senatorcollins	In May, I met with the leaders of Finland &amp; Sweden to convey the strong support they would receive to join the defensive military alliance. Enlarging NATO to include two of our most capable European allies is a necessary response to Russia’s brutal, unprovoked invasion of Ukraine	8	69	53	3	1453
senatorcollins	Tonight, the Senate took a critical step to strengthen NATO by ratifying the memberships of Finland &amp; Sweden. Both countries will bring tremendous benefits to NATO, including proficient militaries, advanced technology, &amp; intimate knowledge of Russia.	22	214	126	6	1454
senatorcollins	For months, @Sen_JoeManchin &amp; I have led a bipartisan group of 16 Senators in crafting a bill to fix the flawed Electoral Count Act of 1887. At the invitation of the Rules Committee, I testified that Congress must seize this opportunity to enact these sensible, necessary reforms.	36	114	156	10	5656
senatorcollins	Maine’s leading drug overdose researcher, Dr. Marci Sorg from @UMaine, recently described our state’s opioid epidemic as “the worst it’s ever been.” I spoke with top public health officials about how we must reduce the supply of drugs &amp; improve prevention programs to save lives.	13	526	35	10	1455
senatorcollins	The average list price of insulin nearly doubled between 2012 and 2016. A bill @SenatorShaheen and I unveiled would help make this lifesaving medication more affordable for the millions of Americans who rely on it for daily treatment. Read more here:	38	6256	146	128	4400
senatorcollins	In 2020, China pledged to purchase over $500 billion worth of U.S. goods—including lobster—under the Phase One Trade Deal, but it has fallen far short of its commitments. At a hearing today, I pressed @USTradeRep to hold China accountable and support Maine’s lobster industry.	25	1302	155	75	1456
senatorcollins	Today, we christened a new destroyer built by the world’s best shipbuilders at BIW. The ship honors John Basilone, a WWII veteran who earned the Medal of Honor and Navy Cross.  Wherever the USS John Basilone sails, the spirit of this valiant Marine will go with her.	25	580	149	21	68
senatorcollins	At the White House, 3 veterans bills I co-sponsored were signed into law, including legislation I co-authored to improve veterans’ access to lifesaving breast cancer screening. Another enacted bill will bestow a Congressional Gold Medal on courageous WWII Army Ranger veterans.	19	474	100	15	5657
senatorcollins	Finland and Sweden would bring tremendous strength to this critical defensive military alliance, including very capable militaries, advanced technology, and intimate knowledge of Russia.	8	205	52	6	1457
senatorcollins	Finland’s and Sweden’s decisions to apply for NATO membership show that Putin’s brutal invasion united rather than divided our allies. I recently met with both countries’ Prime Ministers and the President of Finland to convey the strong support they would receive to join NATO.	16	597	109	12	1458
senatorcollins	The people of Ukraine are inspiring the world by their courage in the face of Putin’s unprovoked and brutal invasion.  I am supporting legislation that will provide an additional $40 billion in aid for Ukraine.	14	232	113	14	1459
senatorcollins	In Kyiv, I met with Ukrainian President Zelensky, who has united his country with his extraordinary leadership. I assured him of Congress’ bipartisan commitment to give Ukraine the military and humanitarian aid they urgently need to protect their people and defend their country.	50	1067	436	74	1460
senatorcollins	I had a great tour of @GDBIW today with @USNavyCNO, saw many friends working at the shipyard, &amp; made new ones--including welding supervisor Mike Sewell! I am so proud of BIW's hardworking employees, &amp; I’ll continue to work to ensure they have the resources to support our Navy.	14	822	62	12	5658
senatorcollins	I joined @SenatorShaheen &amp; @SenJoniErnst at the @UN to discuss with officials how the U.S. &amp; other nations can best support Afghan women &amp; girls under Taliban rule. We will continue to support human rights in Afghanistan as well as address the severe humanitarian crisis.	19	1058	118	66	1461
senatorcollins	The release of 35,000 additional H-2Bs is great news for Maine small businesses! I’ve spoken with @SecMartyWalsh &amp; @SecMayorkas about how vital these visas are during the busy summer season. I appreciated their calls to update me on this relief for Maine’s hospitality industry.	8	425	64	12	1462
senatorcollins	Maine experienced more than 9,500 overdoses &amp; 636 deaths in 2021. To reduce these tragedies, we need better data to help health providers target treatment resources where they are needed most. A top U.S. health official told me she’s committed to improving this data.	10	1130	85	42	1463
senatorcollins	Vladimir Putin has bombed apartment buildings, schools, theaters, shelters, humanitarian corridors, and a maternity hospital. On the Senate floor today, I spoke about the need to supply the Ukrainians with the means to defend their people from these atrocities.	33	631	302	46	4401
senatorcollins	This visit capped an extraordinary trip that included meetings with top military leaders, NGOs, refugees, &amp; government officials. The information we received redoubled my belief that we have to do all we can to provide weapons &amp; humanitarian aid to the brave people of Ukraine.	9	87	39	0	1464
senatorcollins	While there, I had the opportunity to speak with Waterville native Sergeant First Class Dylan Lodge, who is on his sixth deployment.	9	101	69	1	1465
senatorcollins	On the final day of our bipartisan Senate Delegation’s time in Europe, we went to a U.S. Army training base in Germany &amp; met troops recently deployed to deter Russian aggression against our NATO allies.	9	171	96	8	1466
senatorcollins	I remember meeting him in 1987 when he introduced himself to me as he did to probably 100,000 other people: I’m Don Young, the Congressman for all Alaska. Rest In Peace.	12	82	111	2	1467
senatorcollins	This critical airpower will help Ukrainian pilots defend their territory, their people, and help save innocent lives.	17	108	86	10	4402
senatorcollins	It is essential that the Ukrainians have the resources they need to defend their airspace and protect civilians from indiscriminate Russian attacks. This morning, I questioned our nation’s top military intel official about the need to send more aircraft to Ukraine.	41	379	147	11	1468
senatorcollins	We must continue working with European allies to reduce dependence on Russian energy. Rather than turning to authoritarians in the Middle East and South America, we should immediately boost U.S. energy production to lower the soaring price of gas and heating oil.	21	89	123	8	1469
senatorcollins	The U.S. has been purchasing tens of millions of dollars’ worth of Russian oil daily. Following a bipartisan effort I joined, that ends now. Cutting off this key source of revenue, as Ukrainian President Zelensky requested, will put more pressure on Putin.	33	225	240	16	1470
senatorcollins	In addition to rapidly passing a military &amp; humanitarian aid package, the U.S. should ban American imports of Russian oil; revoke Russia’s most-favored-nation status; &amp; send more anti-tank &amp; anti-aircraft missiles, drones, &amp; other lethal weapons as well as non-lethal supplies.	34	81	227	8	1471
senatorcollins	The Ukrainians need our ongoing support to fight Putin’s invasion, &amp; President Zelensky asked for additional help.	16	60	143	3	4403
senatorcollins	This morning, I joined a number of my Senate &amp; House colleagues on a Zoom with Ukrainian President Zelensky. His extraordinary courage has galvanized the Ukrainian people, who are defending their country &amp; their freedom with an inspiring resilience.	39	306	371	10	4404
senatorcollins	The Olympics also showcased the legendary craftsmanship of Mainers.  The footwear worn by Team USA at the opening and closing ceremonies was made in Lewiston.Maine is so proud of our impressive athletes—and the Mainers who outfitted them!	9	70	39	1	1472
senatorcollins	As the 2022 Winter Olympics draw to a close, we congratulate America’s best athletes—including five with Maine ties—whose dedication and skill have been on display for the past two weeks.	10	254	81	9	1473
senatorcollins	I recently urged the Navy Secretary to name a DDG-51 destroyer after this Medal of Honor recipient. In a letter signed by Maine’s entire Delegation &amp; @GovJanetMills, we emphasized that MSG Gordon’s story is one that should be honored by naming a BIW-built ship the USS Gary Gordon	7	49	35	2	1474
senatorcollins	U.S. Navy ships bear the names of those who demonstrated exceptional valor. There’s no doubt that fallen Maine hero MSG Gary Gordon—a Lincoln, Maine, native—is deserving of this honor. His extraordinary sacrifice was made famous by the book &amp; movie Black Hawk Down.	9	56	56	4	1475
senatorcollins	The world’s best athletes have come together for the 2022 Winter Olympics. Among them are five impressive athletes with ties to Maine. I wish each and every one of you the best of luck. Go Team USA! 🇺🇸 🏆 ⛷	5	252	51	2	1476
senatorcollins	.@NOAA's own data show that Maine's lobster industry has never been linked to the death of a right whale, yet lobstermen and women have been subject to onerous, unfair regulations that will not meaningfully protect whales.	8	114	23	4	1477
senatorcollins	The shortage of COVID-19 tests was preventable. Congress provided $82.6 billion for testing, but a lack of federal orders in 2021 forced manufacturers to reduce output and lay off workers. I pressed @HHS_ASPR on why the Administration reallocated funding intended for testing.	46	2043	169	64	5659
senatorcollins	For 70+ years, broadcasting legend Dewey DeWitt was the “Voice of Aroostook County.” The hallmark of his career was his devotion to local sports, especially high school basketball. Whenever I visited Houlton, I loved to see Dewey. I will deeply miss these chats with my friend.	13	359	70	5	1478
senatorcollins	Due to safety and technical issues, the planned deployment of 5G this week threatened to cause even more passenger and cargo flight cancellations. I urged @SecretaryPete to work with the FCC to postpone deployment, and I am pleased they will work to resolve these concerns.	14	198	38	9	5660
senatorcollins	HHS Secretary Becerra called me last week with the good news that the National Alzheimer’s Plan will be updated today to include a risk reduction goal to delay the onset or even help prevent this devastating disease.	11	68	98	8	5661
senatorcollins	Welcome news for Maine’s hospitality industry! Secretary Mayorkas just called to inform me DHS will make an additional 20,000 H-2B visas available. The Secretary and I have repeatedly spoken about how these visas support Maine small businesses and protect the jobs of Mainers.	7	196	98	9	1479
senatorcollins	Johnny Isakson was everyone’s friend and no one‘s enemy. If there had been a vote in the Senate on who the nicest person was, he would have won in a landslide.I am so sorry to learn of his passing and send my heartfelt condolences to Dianne and their children. RIP, my friend.	24	69	328	5	5662
senatorcollins	This is welcome news for students, parents, and teachers in Maine and across America.  I urged the CDC Director to review the proven and successful test-to-stay approach that helps keep children safely in the classroom and prevents learning loss.	9	46	35	4	1480
senatorcollins	The bipartisan infrastructure law is already paying dividends.  The historic investments this legislation will make in Maine’s water infrastructure will help accelerate projects that protect our environment and preserve clean drinking water.	8	125	52	4	1481
senatorcollins	The Senate’s passage of the NDAA today will help strengthen our national security, support our armed forces, and sustain the jobs of hardworking Mainers at BIW, PNSY, and elsewhere across our state who make invaluable contributions to our defense.	6	55	27	4	3551
senatorcollins	The heartfelt tributes at Bob Dole’s memorial at the National Cathedral today celebrated the heroism, patriotism, and service of this great American, who represented the best of the Greatest Generation.  Tom and I were honored to attend the service.	37	231	330	10	4405
senatorcollins	In the U.S. Capitol today, we gathered to pay our respects to Senator Bob Dole, an incredible American hero.	49	145	603	9	1482
senatorcollins	Senator Bob Dole defined the term “The Greatest Generation.” It is with affection, respect, and a heavy heart that I join men and women throughout our nation in saluting a true hero.	59	100	776	7	6550
senatorcollins	The U.S. has an unacceptably high maternal mortality rate w/ stark racial disparities, &amp; this crisis impacts women veterans as well. A bill @SenDuckworth &amp; I authored in the Senate aims to change this. Today, @POTUS signed it into law, which will improve veterans' maternal care.	199	1408	1944	75	1483
senatorcollins	The bipartisan infrastructure package contains the largest-ever investment for broadband.  I co-authored this section of the law, which will provide Maine with approximately $300 million to help expand high-speed internet service.	10	133	73	9	1484
senatorcollins	.@SenatorLeahy, a fellow New Englander I’ve served with for 25 years who announced his retirement today, will be greatly missed in the Senate.  We’ve worked on many issues together affecting New England, and he has served the United States and Vermont well.	11	61	90	3	1485
senatorcollins	This law will make historic investments in Maine’s infrastructure:✅$1.3 billion for roads &amp; highways✅$225 million for bridges✅$300 million for broadband✅$73.5 million for airports✅$250 million for public transportation✅$254 million for water infrastructure	43	69	259	7	1486
senatorcollins	The bipartisan infrastructure package is good for America. Today, I attended the White House signing ceremony for this bill I negotiated with nine of my colleagues that will make the most significant infrastructure investment since the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s.	147	215	1466	31	1487
senatorcollins	Charles Shay is an American hero who earned the Silver Star for his courageous actions as a medic on D-Day. On the 75th anniversary of the Allied landing, I was honored to join Charles in Normandy.  Thank you to Charles and all of our veterans for their sacrifice and bravery.	11	45	65	3	3769
senatorcollins	Happy Veterans Day to all of the brave men and women who have served our nation in uniform!  Mainers will always be grateful for the sacrifices you have made to protect our country and preserve our freedom.	19	68	123	3	4406
senatorcollins	I was proud to partner with @SenatorShaheen to lead the negotiations on one of the most significant provisions for Maine -- $65 billion to expand high-speed Internet access.	7	43	56	6	1488
senatorcollins	This transformational infrastructure package is good for America. It will make the most significant investment in our infrastructure since the establishment of the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s.	27	106	130	12	1489
senatorcollins	That’s why I authored the HAVANA Act with @MarkWarner, @marcorubio, and @SenatorShaheen, a new law which ensures that these brave Americans will receive the health care financial assistance that they deserve.	6	20	36	3	4407
senatorcollins	Americans who have suffered from these debilitating attacks while serving our country should be treated the same way we would treat a soldier who suffered a traumatic brain injury on the battlefield.	7	14	37	0	4408
SenatorCardin	Two great leaders, friends and Marylanders. Thank you @LeaderHoyer and @SpeakerPelosi for leading our party through some of the most challenging times in our country’s history.	3	2	25	0	4409

SenatorCardin	Unfortunately, we expected this kind of treatment of Brittany when she was wrongfully detained in February.	3	6	14	0	6551
SenatorCardin	Russian authorities continue to show callous disregard for justice in the treatment of Brittany Griner. Sending Brittany to an infamous penal colony is despicable and cruel. We need to bring her home.	14	14	49	3	4410
SenatorCardin	Today we celebrated 20 years of @NOAA’s B-WET program, which gets young people out into our watershed &amp; teaches the importance of environmental stewardship. This program really punches above its weight in getting the next generation involved in the movement.	6	3	13	2	5663
SenatorCardin	The US-Saudi relationship is important to our national security but it shouldn't provide immunity to anyone who engages in such horrific actions. Diplomatic immunity has been waived for far lesser crimes. There must be justice &amp; accountability for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.	16	1	58	2	1492
SenatorCardin	Appalling news. The CIA concluded that MBS ordered Jamal Khashoggi’s killing. Not only does immunity here go against @POTUS’s commitment to hold MBS accountable for this heinous crime, it sets a dangerous precedent.	99	28	237	8	5664
SenatorCardin	I am proud that some of the innovation in manufacturing that will bring us to zero-emission trucking is happening right here in Maryland.	22	8	58	0	1493

SenatorCardin	Thirteen years. Thirteen years today since Sergei Magnitsky was tortured and died in Russian custody for telling the truth. I am committed to honoring his bravery and legacy by continuing to strengthen the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act.	15	2	53	1	4411
SenatorCardin	If there’s one thing about me, it’s that I’m going to talk about Maryland. We are proof that the #BipartisanInfrastructureLaw is working and transforming communities.	3	9	22	0	1496
SenatorCardin	I applaud the continued efforts of @USAmbHungary to promote human rights and an independent judiciary in Hungary. Strong U.S.-Hungary ties are paramount in light of Russia’s ongoing aggression in Ukraine.	5	2	10	2	1497
SenatorCardin	This Congress has an opportunity to show the LGBTQ+ community that we have their back and so does the law. With pride, I will be voting “yes” to codify protections on the Supreme Court’s same-sex marriage ruling. No more steps backwards. The world is watching.	11	8	54	0	5667
SenatorCardin	We have to do more of both: reduce emissions and limits the impacts. This is not just an issue for Americans. We need all the world to work together. We need to build the sky-high cost of carbon into our decisions. The power is in our hands. #COP27	3	0	12	0	4412
SenatorCardin	The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is what this country desperately needed a year ago to start future-proofing our economy. We’ve committed $97 billion for climate solutions like a national network for electric car chargers and modernizing the electric grid.	8	5	26	0	3553

SenatorCardin	When @POTUS  took office, I was optimistic that we could make strides in the fight against climate change, and we’ve done that with the Inflation Reduction Act, but the work isn’t over. We’re here at #COP27 to learn and listen from those who know best, the scientists.	12	9	54	0	3554

SenatorCardin	It’s not a close call. Prince George’s County is the best site for the FBI headquarters.

SenMarkey	The CVAA was a landmark piece of legislation, but it's time for an update. The Communications, Technology, and Video Accessibility Act will provide opportunity, independence, and inclusion for all Americans now and in the future.	22	41	82	6	3557
SenMarkey	Twitter is already on privacy probation and we're seeing fresh chaos every day. That's why I'm joining @SenBlumenthal in asking the @FTC to investigate any breach of Twitter’s consent decree or other violations. No company is above the law and Twitter must answer to the FTC.	175	1613	577	219	5675
SenMarkey	My bill will amend the CVAA and ensure that people with disabilities have full access to mainstream communication products and services while laying the foundation for an accessible future.	5	6	35	0	3558
SenMarkey	Technology has changed a lot in the 12 years since I authored the CVAA. But our obligation to make sure that everyone has equal access to the services and technologies they need hasn't. That's why I'm proud to introduce the Communications, Video, and Technology Accessibility Act.	28	23	86	6	3559
SenMarkey	That's right. And that's why the Senate needs to pass my Right to Contraception Act to make sure that everyone has access to this essential care.	52	58	289	2	5676
SenMarkey	I welcome news that the U.S. has taken a long overdue step towards accountability by opening a criminal investigation into the Israeli army killing of Palestinian American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh.

SenMarkey	One of your companies is under an FTC consent decree. Auto safety watchdog NHTSA is investigating another for killing people. And you’re spending your time picking fights online. Fix your companies. Or Congress will.	26803	10720	198474	4376	5678

SenMarkey	A @washingtonpost reporter was able to create a verified account impersonating me—I’m asking for answers from @elonmusk who is putting profits over people and his debt over stopping disinformation. Twitter must explain how this happened and how to prevent it from happening again.	11106	9077	73593	1585	5679
SenMarkey	The rapid platform changes and removal of these safeguards are dangerous and Twitter and its leadership have a responsibility to the public to ensure the platform doesn’t become a breeding ground for manipulation and deceit.	369	127	2183	21	5680
SenMarkey	Last night, I was easily impersonated and the account was quickly verified. Safeguards like blue checks let users be smart, critical consumers of news and information in Twitter’s global town square. Truth can’t be put on sale for $8.	1006	169	3962	95	5681
SenMarkey	I’m proud to announce the MBTA has been awarded $576,000 to develop long-term plans for the Red Line to keep pace with its increasing ridership. As the MBTA works to provide safe, reliable service, I will keep fighting for robust federal funding.	38	63	497	9	5682

SenMarkey	Ahead of COP27 next week, I'm leading my colleagues in urging @POTUS to strengthen the US' position as a global leader in combatting climate change. The administration must use all available tools to reduce emissions and support nations most vulnerable to climate change.	11	15	63	3	73
SenMarkey	In 2007, we had a Republican President who denied the reality of climate change, a Congress that refused to act, and I spoke to COP13 as a virtual avatar. Now, I'm heading to COP27 in person, with a President ready to tackle the climate crisis and a freshly passed climate bill.	18	15	66	3	74
SenMarkey	The peaceful transfer of power is a pillar of democracy. Brazil had successful, free, and fair elections, and I look forward to working with newly elected President Lula as he comes to office.	13	5	54	2	1530
SenMarkey	The hyper-partisan Supreme Court majority and radical Republicans have plunged Americans in states across the country into a dystopian post-Roe era. The FDA must address this public health crisis and ensure access to medication abortion.	16	8	40	0	4418
SenMarkey	It was an honor to welcome @VP Harris back to Boston yesterday to celebrate $300 million in new funding for families across Massachusetts.

SenMarkey	Eight of the top oil and gas companies made $139 billion in profit in the first nine months of 2022 alone. We don't need windfall profits for the 1%, we need wind power energy for all. It's time for Congress to stand up to Big Oil and impose a tax on windfall profits.	159	96	393	15	5683
SenMarkey	Good. Fossil fuel companies are making record profits by price gouging at the pump. President Biden is right to put the needs of the American people over Big Oil's profits. It’s time for Congress to pass the Big Oil Windfall Profits Tax Act now.	35	12	78	1	3562
SenMarkey	Just 62 years ago, federal marshals escorted 6-year-old Ruby Bridges into a desegregated school. And still, BIPOC students are facing huge educational barriers. We don't live in a race-neutral society, and SCOTUS shouldn't create additional barriers to equal access to education.	14	6	46	0	5684
SenMarkey	The Emergency Connectivity Fund has helped over 12 million students connect to the internet but the funds are quickly running out. We can't let this essential program end. Congress must provide new funding to preserve these hard-earned gains.	6	6	27	0	5685
SenMarkey	I hope for a full and speedy recovery for Paul Pelosi. My thoughts are with the entire Pelosi family. As a nation we must condemn all violence—including politically motivated attacks—and the misinformation and hate that fuels it.	37	23	162	1	6555
SenMarkey	It was an honor to join @UUSC and tribal leaders for their briefing on the heavy burden of climate displacement on Indigenous communities. I am inspired by your leadership and remain firm in my commitment to bold, just climate action that doesn’t leave communities behind.	4	3	23	0	4419
SenMarkey	However the U.S. must go much further to dismantle Trump’s dangerous policies. @POTUS must establish a No First Use nuclear policy and act boldly to confront nuclear peril.	5	0	20	2	1534
SenMarkey	.@SecDef is demonstrating responsible leadership with his decisions to stop the development of a new nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missile, a weapon that I’ve long fought against, and by keeping the door open to arms control, risk reduction, and diplomacy with China &amp; Russia.	4	2	14	2	1535
SenMarkey	The Biden Administration’s latest Nuclear Posture Review, while improving on the Trump administration’s, has missed crucial opportunities to improve U.S. nuclear policy.	12	4	25	0	1536
SenMarkey	Today marks the fourth anniversary of the antisemitic Tree of Life Synagogue shooting. We must honor the 11 lives tragically lost, by remaining firm in our commitment to dismantle white supremacy and confront hatred and bigotry wherever it occurs.	8	3	56	1	211

SenMarkey	The other lives put at risk are those of people who can’t safely access abortion and reproductive health care because an illegitimate far-right Supreme Court took away rights that some of the Justices swore to preserve.	11	10	83	3	5686
SenMarkey	It was an honor to join @HarvardIOP students for last night's conversation about the power of young people in American democracy.

RoyBlunt	Of course, an important part of this discussion is eliminating the stigma around behavioral health care. An estimated 1 in 5 Americans has a diagnosable, and almost always treatable, behavioral health issue.	2	5	4	0	4549

RoyBlunt	After 82 days as vice president under FDR, Harry S. Truman became president on April 12, 1945, during the final months of World War II. It has been an honor to serve Missourians in the same office space as a man who did so much for this country.	4	9	14	2	89

RoyBlunt	President Truman’s tenacity, character, and courage to confront difficult problems are values admired by his fellow Missourians &amp; people who study our history. No president faced more crucial decisions than those Truman confronted in the first nine months of his presidency.	6	19	26	3	4555
RoyBlunt	On September 11th, thousands of lives were lost and countless more lives were never the same. Our first responders showed the world the resilience of the American spirit. Even as we mourned, Americans showed our strength in the face of unimaginable tragedy.	5	25	50	1	4556

RoyBlunt	Americans need relief from the economic strain they are facing, not another politically-driven policy that benefits the wealthy at the expense of those who can least afford it.	8	36	26	3	4557
RoyBlunt	The Biden administration’s student loan plan is a one-two punch for hardworking Americans. It's a handout for high-income college &amp; advanced degree graduates paid for by taxpayers who had no part in taking out the loans.	23	189	80	17	4558
RoyBlunt	Today, Missouri turns the big 2-0-1. In those years, Missourians have shaped our American history and our way of life in countless ways. Our state’s rich heritage is one to be celebrated. Happy birthday, Missouri!	8	90	53	3	1716
RoyBlunt	This bill maintains a rigorous vetting process while providing an opportunity for Afghan refugees to rebuild their lives in America. I urge our colleagues to support this bipartisan effort to help those who helped us.	7	9	33	2	1717
RoyBlunt	Nearly a year ago, thousands of our Afghan allies fled their homes as their country fell to the Taliban. These evacuees are people who stood by our service members, risking their safety and the safety of their loved ones, in support of the U.S. mission in Afghanistan.	3	30	34	0	1718

SenatorTester	Let's be clear here: This is a leadership issue.Our postal workers in Bozeman are going above and beyond by skipping days off and picking up extra shifts to try to deliver the mail, but Postmaster General DeJoy needs to listen to Montanans and get more staff on the ground ASAP.	33	11	196	3	1819
SenatorTester	Montanans have long voted by mail, and with Election Day just around the corner, timely mail service couldn't be more critical.But despite our efforts, the @USPS is horribly behind and severely understaffed in Gallatin County—and Postmaster General Louis DeJoy needs to fix it.	132	32	550	14	4610
SenatorTester	Public school teachers are foundational to the success of kids and communities across the Treasure State, and students in Great Falls are surrounded by some of the best. Wishing all Great Falls educators a happy #TreasureOurTeachers week.	17	20	147	0	1820
SenatorTester	The attack on Paul Pelosi is despicable and a direct affront to our American democracy. Let’s be clear: this country can’t survive if political violence becomes the norm. Everyone needs to turn down the blatantly divisive language and put our democracy first.	363	204	2408	31	4611
SenatorTester	Montana's first responders put it all on the line to protect us, and we owe them a big debt of gratitude. On National First Responders Day and every other day, I'm grateful to the folks who run towards danger to keep our families and communities safe.	40	4	202	0	1821
SenatorTester	Today, I visited the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Rzeszow, Poland and had the privilege of sitting down with UNHCR leadership and two Ukrainian refugees.

SenatorTester	By cutting out middlemen and investing in local food systems, Montana producers will benefit from better margins and Montana families will receive high-quality food at more affordable prices. It's a win-win—thanks in large part to the American Rescue Plan.	14	6	64	0	1829

Core inflation is at a 40-year high.Dems’ radical spending policies at work.	65	240	190	10	5785

SenatorFischer	It’s concerning that the NYT seems to have more access to Biden’s new classified counterterrorism strategy than Congress.These new policies appear to overly centralize decision-making. This reduces our ability to react to threats in places like Afghanistan. (1/2)	4	33	11	1	1836

SenatorFischer	Inflation remains at a near 40-year high. The economic cheerleading at the White House doesn’t help families across the country who continue to shoulder the financial burden of reckless government spending.	47	185	145	6	5789
SenatorFischer	Reminder: Senate Dems passed a bill this weekend to unleash 87,000 IRS agents on hardworking Americans and small businesses. They need to audit the middle class to fund more of their reckless spending bills. And they have the audacity to call this inflation relief?	15	111	61	3	4625

SenatorFischer	Democrats just pushed through yet another reckless tax and spending spree. My statement below.	47	498	174	23	4626
SenatorFischer	I introduced a provision to restrict the usage of these tax credits so taxpayer funds aren’t being wasted on the rich and their luxury vehicles. Every Senate Democrat voted against it.	8	85	23	3	4627
SenatorFischer	Dems always talk about the importance of making the rich pay their fair share, yet their reckless tax and spending bill gives the rich another tax break. Their bill expands electric vehicle tax credits for the wealthy.No wonder so many Americans see Washington as out of touch.	61	853	213	40	1860
SenatorFischer	Billions of dollars in reckless spending and major tax hikes will not solve the economic hardship families are facing right now. Yet somehow this concoction of truly terrible economic policies is exactly what Dems are trying to push through the Senate tonight.	16	101	70	8	4628

SenSasse	It looks like the President and his team have a plan that is just to accept the risk that we will leave Americans behind. Leaving a single American behind is a disaster. It's a dereliction of duty. It's a national disgrace.	66	365	304	29	4632
SenSasse	Damn the deadline. The American people are not going to surrender our fellow citizens to the Taliban.

SenSasse	Barbara Bush lived an extraordinary life of devotion, love, and laughter. She was a blessing to the First Family and the nation. Melissa and I lift up the entire Bush family in our prayers during this time.	116	201	1231	6	6616
SenSasse	It is good news that today the President directed Larry Kudlow and Ambassador Lighthizer to negotiate U.S. entry into TPP:	277	230	651	167	1878
SenSasse	Thank you, @NDSS, for bringing the voices of Macy, Clay, and Alijah to Capitol Hill. These kids have a lot to teach us. #BWW2018	65	36	471	10	3776
SenSasse	Facebook is a really big and powerful platform. Their decisions on how to police speech will have far-reaching consequences. That’s why I asked Mark Zuckerberg in today's hearing to define “hate speech.”It is a hard question and an important conversation.	1206	305	4200	199	5798
SenSasse	Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. persevered, even unto death, in asserting the god-given rights of all Americans.Read the full text of his final speech, here - it will give you chills:  May we never lose sight of his message. #MLK50	95	72	270	4	4644
SenSasse	Total dysfunction. DC is about to add 1.3 TRILLION $ to your debt like it’s no big deal - and meanwhile both of our crazy uncles are fistfighting in the backyard. Happy Thanksgiving, America.	3745	1731	12540	492	1879
SenSasse	Full text of the letter @SenJohnMcCain and I sent seeking a coordinated NATO response to Russia.	198	130	550	33	1880
SenSasse	Let’s get this straight: Equifax put millions of Americans at risk, got a no-bid contract from the feds, and at least one employee turned a personal profit from trading on the misfortune of the victims? Someone needs to answer for this.	174	81	535	16	4645
SenSasse	Op-ed with @NEFarmBureau: We need to drop the talk of unnecessary and painful trade wars and work to protect NAFTA. Nebraskans have won with NAFTA and scrapping the agreement would be a disastrously bad idea.​	56	44	163	3	4646
SenSasse	We’ve tried tariffs like these a bunch of times over the last two centuries. Every time, American families have suffered. This trade policy will be disastrous.	515	294	1312	76	4647
SenSasse	Trade is great for America. It's great for American families. Trade creates jobs &amp; lowers prices for American families. Trade wars do the opposite. No trade war has ever worked. We don't want to make America 1930 again.	1347	2201	3806	296	1881
SenSasse	#OnThisDay 151 years ago, Nebraska officially became a state. Today we celebrate the pioneers, caretakers of the land, statesmen, and volunteers who have made our state so great.	221	85	848	52	1882
SenSasse	Sports don’t just build character; they reveal it. Kudos to Rachel Mulligan, whose cross country skiing earned medals in the 500m freestyle race &amp; 1km freestyle race in the @SpecialOlympics Winter World Games in Austria. Thanks for making Nebraska proud! @SONebraska #SOHillDay	37	139	400	7	1883
SenSasse	"Today we remember the ""Buffalo Soldiers"" who served at Nebraska’s Ft Robinson nearly 100 years before the Civil Rights Act. These volunteers suffered indignities from their colleagues, commanding officers, and even from the very citizens they worked to protect. #BlackHistoryMonth"	159	71	542	14	1884
SenSasse	Honored to have @NEStatePatrol’s John Lewis as my #SOTU guest tonight. This hero went above &amp; beyond to serve his neighbor after hurricanes ravaged the Florida Keys. America needs more neighbors like him.	78	112	319	11	1885
SenSasse	Tomorrow, hundreds of thousands will travel to Washington, D.C. from across the country to #MarchForLife. The crowd will fill city blocks. But the real movement is even bigger. #WhyWeMarch	186	200	617	26	1886
SenSasse	This is national security 101: Washington should be hunting down terrorists who fund global violence with domestic drug money.	40	48	114	9	1887
SenSasse	It’s not helpful to call the press the enemy of the American people. Here’s why. #1a	3561	1587	8010	581	4648
SenSasse	What this terrifying statistic tells us: we are failing to teach the First Amendment to the next generation.	274	155	547	53	3590
SenSasse	The First Amendment is the beating heart of the American experiment, and you don’t get to separate the five freedoms that are in there.	247	87	638	17	4649

SenatorBurr	More great news for NC: The Army Corps of Engineers announced an additional $15M investment in river basin and beach studies throughout Eastern NC. These studies will give us valuable information on better preventing and mitigating future storm damage.	7	85	48	4	2147
SenatorBurr	The Army Corps of Engineers just announced another $281M to reduce storm damage in NC. So far in 2020:💲237M to Surf City/N. Topsail Beach💲44.5M to Carteret County💲39.6M to Princeville These projects will go a long way in protecting Eastern NC communities.	24	86	83	6	2148
SenatorBurr	I toured Princeville with Mayor Jones after Hurricane Matthew. It was clear then we needed better infrastructure in place to reduce future storm damage. The Army Corps’ announcement that this is finally happening is very welcome news.	3	18	19	1	2149

SenatorBurr	Iran and the Iranian people can now turn away from Soleimani’s murderous adventurism, redirect the Quds Force’s money into Iran’s economy, bring home the troops Soleimani sent abroad, and move forward toward building a more peaceful region. 4/4	13	171	75	22	2152
SenatorBurr	Soleimani is also responsible in part for Iran’s current economic strife, as he put his violent campaigns and the enrichment of the corrupt Quds Force ahead of the interests of the Iranian people. 3/4	14	20	60	0	2153
SenatorBurr	Under Soleimani, Iran has become the single most destabilizing force in the Middle East and an exporter of tyranny throughout the region. The blood of hundreds of thousands of innocent Iraqis, Yemenis, Syrians, Israelis, and countless others is on his hands. 2/4	12	16	35	3	2154
SenatorBurr	Qassem Soleimani was the personification of a state sponsor of terrorism. At his direction, hundreds of American servicemen were killed and thousands more injured. At his urging, U.S. allies were attacked repeatedly and undermined by Iran’s Quds Force and their proxies. 1/4	56	156	217	9	2155

SenatorBurr	Even now, 78 years later, December 7, 1941 is still a date that lives in infamy. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, a generation of Americans rose to meet the challenge of their time: to defend freedom from tyranny and win the war that came to them.	53	123	254	12	4790

SenThomTillis	Joe Biden’s open borders have created a serious humanitarian and security crisis. We need to secure the border!	53	179	218	7	6683
SenThomTillis	Make no mistake, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has resulted in the deaths of countless and led to the largest refugee crisis in Europe since World War II.

SenThomTillis	President Biden decided to have his speech at an empty metro center where businesses are leaving due to rising crime and skyrocketing bills caused by inflation. Quite the symbolic backdrop to represent the consequences of his failed policies.	19	36	55	1	6684
SenThomTillis	Out-of-control inflation, largely caused by Biden’s overspending, once again forced the Fed to raise interest rates. It’s long past time for Congress to pursue common-sense fiscal restraint to get our economy back on track.	26	171	104	14	5871
SenThomTillis	Democrat policies shoveling cash at our problems aren’t working. Instead of recklessly spending taxpayers’ dollars, we need to focus on cutting through bureaucratic red tape and less taxes to create economic prosperity and get our economy back on track.	47	81	180	5	4792

SenThomTillis	Efforts to ram through hurried rulemaking without proper analysis, deliberation or consideration of negative impacts is nothing short of regulatory malpractice. The SEC should focus on its requirements to protect investors, maintain fair markets, and facilitate capital formation.	2	2	6	1	5872
SenThomTillis	Gensler must provide answers to the recent @SECGov IG report, which raises serious concerns about significant operational dysfunction w/n the agency &amp; makes it hard to understand how the SEC is adequately performing due-diligence &amp; analysis required for its many pending rules.	2	12	8	0	5873
SenThomTillis	For the past two years, Democrats in Congress and the White House have spent taxpayer's dollars without limits, and their failed policies have caused the highest inflation this nation has seen in decades.	190	765	941	33	4793
SenThomTillis	Before Biden, our country had a thriving energy sector. Now, because of his anti-domestic energy policies we have become reliant on foreign oil and our competitors like Russia and Iran are benefitting.	163	657	828	34	2171
SenThomTillis	Since Joe Biden took office energy prices are up 45% and gas prices are up $1.50. Experts are now warning that utility bills could leap around 40% this year.	16	106	53	6	6685
SenThomTillis	The attack on Paul Pelosi is beyond disgusting and reprehensible. Praying for his complete recovery and I'm glad law enforcement has arrested the perpetrator.

senrobportman	In the past year, #Ohio has received over $4 billion from the infrastructure law, including $258 million for public transportation, $209 million to repair and upgrade bridges, $54 million for airports, $20 million for Army Corps water projects &amp; $5 million for broadband.	2	5	6	0	2264
senrobportman	Today marks the one-year anniversary of signing the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment &amp; #Jobs Act into law. This infrastructure law has provided historic new resources to #Ohio to upgrade and rebuild our roads, bridges, broadband, ports, and rail.	10	21	31	1	2265
senrobportman	Jane and I are heartbroken to learn that one of Ohio’s own lost his life in the devastating accident at the Texas Air show over the weekend. Our prayers are with Major Curtis Rowe’s family and friends in the Hilliard community.	3	10	28	0	2266
senrobportman	My joint statement with @SenatorBaldwin, @SenatorCollins, @kyrstensinema, and @SenThomTillis on the Respect for Marriage Act:	8	47	65	5	3633
senrobportman	The FED is reducing demand by raising interest rates and unemployment with the only tools they have. That hurts. Congress needs to act on the fiscal side to help get us through this with pro-growth policies that increase supply and reduce costs for working families.	7	29	29	1	5902
senrobportman	Ukraine’s recent battlefield successes near Kerson continue to show that, with enough support from the West, they can win this war. Ukraine has proven that they deserve the support of freedom-loving countries around the world who value the territorial integrity of all nations.	9	27	46	6	2267
senrobportman	Ukraine is a sovereign country and has every right to defend itself from Russia’s brutal attack. As Ukrainian forces continue to advance on the battlefield, we must provide them with the weapons they need to maintain their momentum.	13	75	123	14	2268
senrobportman	The U.S. economy needs a change. I urge the Biden admin to work with Republicans to get back to pro-growth, common-sense economic policies that were helping Americans prior to the pandemic.	30	248	221	21	2269
senrobportman	Democrats’ deliberate policy choices including unprecedented stimulus spending and supply constraints on energy have driven inflation to the record high rates we see today.	5	24	14	1	4817
senrobportman	High inflation is straining Americans’ budgets, making everything more expensive. Consumer prices have increased a total of 13.9% since @POTUS took office.	27	193	164	11	4818
senrobportman	The liberation of Kherson is another well-executed and hard-fought victory that sends the message to the world that with the with the right tools, Ukraine can win this war.	82	39	560	4	2270
senrobportman	Hoping for another big win by #2 ranked @OhioStateFB today as they welcome @IndianaFootball to The Shoe! #GoBucks	3	11	16	1	5903
senrobportman	Great to join @ChrisCoons and @BretBaier for @SpecialReport last night to discuss our recent bipartisan trip to #Ukraine and the results of the 2022 midterms. Check out our interview here:	3	15	10	2	2271
senrobportman	"RT @SquawkCNBC: ""In the Senate, it's up in the air. When Joe Biden ran for president, he talked about bringing people together. He's never…"	11	0	0	0	5904
senrobportman	Brave Ukrainian soldiers once again show us that, with the right tools, they can win this war. The U.S. must not let up in our support for #Ukraine.	8	13	27	2	2272
senrobportman	Great news out of southern #Ukraine today. This is the result of a well-executed and patient Ukrainian counteroffensive that was made possible by U.S. military aid, particularly HIMARS.	7	26	70	1	2273
senrobportman	The war crimes committed by Vladimir Putin and his associates are reprehensible and Russia should be held accountable for their horrific actions. #Ukraine has the right to defend itself against this unjustified invasion and the U.S. must not let up in our support now.	11	13	33	0	2274
senrobportman	As Ukraine continues to defend itself against this brutal Russian invasion, it is clear that Ukrainian soldiers are putting weapons and equipment they receive from the West to good use.	16	37	57	4	2275
senrobportman	It is critical that we come together as a global community to hold Vladimir Putin and his regime accountable, just as we have come together to support #Ukraine’s fight to defend itself.	4	12	23	1	2276
senrobportman	President Putin must be held accountable for these crimes. This is why we went to The Hague to meet with officials from the International Criminal Court and Prosecutor Khan to discuss how the U.S. can better support their efforts to deliver justice to the people of Ukraine.	5	8	15	0	2277
senrobportman	During my visit to Kyiv with @ChrisCoons, we saw compelling evidence that Vladimir Putin and other Russian leaders are committing atrocities and war crimes in #Ukraine.	13	36	38	2	2278
senrobportman	Thank you @OMarkarova. The United States stands with Ukraine in this fight against Russian aggression! Slava Ukraini!	16	42	60	1	2279
senrobportman	It was great to join @p_m_robinson to discuss my time in the Senate. Check out the interview below ⬇️	2	20	10	0	5905
senrobportman	The international community must join Ukraine in ensuring that Putin is held accountable for his heinous actions during this invasion.	13	8	39	2	2280
senrobportman	I also met with the Ukrainian Prosecutor General @AndriyKostinUa, and discussed efforts in Ukraine, the United States, and at the International Criminal Court to investigate Vladimir Putin and his allies for war crimes.	13	12	50	1	2281
senrobportman	I also visited the HQ of @NPCUkrenergo, site of a recent Russian attack on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. Russian attacks on critical civilian infrastructure is of no military value but continues to cripple the Ukrainian economy and put the lives of Ukrainian civilians at risk.	12	10	36	1	2282
senrobportman	Even as Russia bombs civilian infrastructure and commits violent atrocities, Ukrainian resolve does not waiver. The Ukrainian strength of spirit is seen every day on the battlefield, where Ukrainian armed forces continue to regain territory.	13	32	73	4	2283
senrobportman	In a meeting with @ZelenskyyUA today, I said the U.S. must remain committed to aiding Ukraine to victory. I believe a Ukrainian victory is necessary to reaffirm the importance of the sovereignty of free nations and the importance of upholding international law around the globe.	25	106	143	19	2284
senrobportman	Happy National #Ohio Day to the best state in the country! Today we celebrate the Buckeye State and the anniversary of #Ohio joining the union. #NationalOhioDay	4	17	39	0	2285
senrobportman	Tonight’s Monday Night Football features the Battle of #Ohio as the @Browns and @Bengals face off. A great day for #Ohio sports! #CINvsCLE #MNF	4	34	25	1	2286
senrobportman	Happy Halloween! Wishing all of the #Ohio trick-or-treaters a safe and fun holiday.	4	27	21	2	2287
senrobportman	Now economic growth is slowing. The U.S. economy grew at a 0.1% rate year-to-date and American’s are facing nearly 40 year high inflation.	4	38	26	2	2288
senrobportman	Soaring inflation, slowing economic growth, and a looming recession is product of 21 months of Democrat policy mismanagement and refusal to work in a bipartisan way to grow the economy.	73	426	454	21	4819
senrobportman	All Americans deserve an opportunity to have a safe and secure retirement. My bipartisan Retirement Security and Savings Act will provide new opportunities to save for those who need it the most.	7	30	31	1	4820
senrobportman	As Ukrainian forces continue to advance on the battlefield, we must provide them with the weapons they need to maintain their momentum.	8	90	42	5	4821
senrobportman	I am pleased to see the U.S. announce an additional $275 million in military aid to ensure that #Ukraine has the resources it needs to win this war against Russian brutality.	10	93	102	9	2289
senrobportman	Looking forward to watching @OhioStateFB add another victory to their undefeated season when they play @PennStateFball today! Another strong showing by Bucks quarterback CJ Stroud puts him in a good position to win the Heisman trophy. #GoBucks	4	7	13	0	5906
senrobportman	Powerful speech from @ZelenskyyUa about the unending Russian missile and run attacks on Ukrainian civilians.	10	20	27	1	4822
senrobportman	The break in at Nancy Pelosi’s home and attack on her 82 year old husband is outrageous. We must all stand up against this violence. I wish Mr. Pelosi a speedy and full recovery.	221	398	2261	27	6714
senrobportman	According to recent data from @CBP, 98 individuals on the terror watchlist were apprehended trying to enter the US between ports of entry in the last year. When will this admin wake up to the danger posed by their failed border policies?	10	109	32	5	2290
senrobportman	My op-ed with @SenatorCardin in @thehill highlights the need for Congress to complete work on bipartisan legislation to strengthen our country’s retirement system and help Americans better save for retirement. Check it out here:	2	34	2	1	4823
senrobportman	The first 2 years of the Biden admin have been the highest 2 years of unlawful migration in our nation’s history. The Sept @CBP numbers show more than 227,500 total encounters at the border, a new record for the month of September.	3	16	5	0	5907
senrobportman	The Biden admin’s border crisis has broken its own record for the most encounters during a fiscal year with 2.4 million border encounters, the highest of any fiscal year on record.	11	53	17	4	6715
senrobportman	Instead of focusing on higher taxes and more spending, the Biden administration should work with Republicans on pro-growth policies that will improve our economy and help get flight inflation under control.	2	26	8	0	4824
senrobportman	Moreover, wage growth is not keeping up with today’s surging inflation. That means families trying to make ends meet must try to do more with less. The Democrats’ reckless taxing and spending has made this crisis worse.	1	11	9	0	4825
senrobportman	While today’s GDP report reflects increased exports, the American people continue to feel the painful effects of today’s skyrocketing inflation through higher costs for groceries, housing, and energy bills.	1	45	15	1	4826
senrobportman	Today, I released a joint statement with @SenatorCardin in response to the distorted report from the @UN_HRC’s Commission of Inquiry (COI) into the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Read our statement here:	9	21	41	4	4827
senrobportman	My bipartisan bill will coordinate efforts to protect US research, stop spies from hiding affiliations with foreign govts on grant applications, and give the State Dept the needed authority to stop bad actors from exploiting our open research community.	2	5	6	0	2291
senrobportman	Like @FBIDirectorWray said earlier today, we are facing a “coordinated effort across the Chinese government to lie, cheat, and steal their way into unfairly dominating entire technology sectors.”	3	3	8	3	4828
senrobportman	The 3 recent indictments from DOJ against numerous Chinese spies operating in the US, some of whom used academic covers to attempt to steal US fingerprint technology, is another reason why Congress must pass my Safeguarding American Innovation Act.	7	24	20	2	2292
senrobportman	Alarmingly, according to the @DEAHQ, the vast majority of fentanyl is getting across the southern border undetected. The lack of enforcement of our border by this admin is creating a pull factor for Mexican transnational criminal orgs to push deadly drugs into our communities.	1	17	5	0	4829
senrobportman	The Sept @CBP operational stats show that 1,826lbs of fentanyl were seized last month, more than enough to kill every American. This surge in deadly illicit narcotics coming over our border continues to endanger lives in #Ohio &amp; the US.	3	31	13	0	2293
senrobportman	By every measure, working families are feeling the pain of rising prices. Americans need relief and we must stop stimulus spending contributing to this record inflation and promote pro-growth, common-sense economic policies.	8	37	30	0	4830
senrobportman	Americans are getting squeezed by surging grocery prices. Since @POTUS took office grocery prices have risen by 17.7%.	72	364	265	24	4831
senrobportman	It is clear that Ukrainian soldiers are putting weapons &amp; equipment provided by the US &amp; over 40 countries to good use &amp; making progress on the battlefield. #Ukraine has the right to defend itself against this unjustified invasion and the U.S. must not let up in our support now.	13	24	53	0	2294
senrobportman	After 9 months of Russia’s aggression, #Ukraine continues a bold counteroffensive to retake more of Russian-occupied territory in the east and south.	10	6	49	0	2295
senrobportman	The United States and our allies must continue to provide additional air defense systems to help #Ukraine defend against these barbaric Russian missle attacks on civilians.	41	114	202	15	2296
senrobportman	American families need common-sense economic policies that Republicans had in place prior to the pandemic that produced record economic growth, higher wages, and low inflation.	29	75	128	1	4832
senrobportman	Bad policies that dramatically expanded stimulus spending and demand for goods while restricting the supply of products, including energy, have helped fuel the highest level of inflation in 40 years and Americans are now paying the price.	10	80	43	1	4833
senrobportman	Best of luck to top ranked @OhioStateFB as they take on @HawkeyeFootball today at The Shoe. #GoBucks	1	15	11	0	5908
senrobportman	I will continue to lead efforts in the Senate to protect the privacy of American citizens from these social media companies &amp; ensure that we step away from this environment where social media platforms know all, yet the users, policymakers, and the public know very little.	1	9	13	0	4834
senrobportman	At a recent #HSGAC hearing, TikTok’s executive refused to commit to cutting off Americans’ data from China-based employees. American data should be safe from exploitation by the CCP.	1	6	12	3	2297
senrobportman	I am alarmed by recent reports that a #China-based team at TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, planned to use TikTok data to monitor the location of American citizens.	22	48	44	7	2298
senrobportman	I’m saddened to learn of the tragic plane crash yesterday in Marietta. Jane and I extend our deepest condolence to the victims’ families.	2	5	14	0	2299
senrobportman	Threats to American national security are growing every day. We must ensure our military is prepared to deter and defeat those threats by increasing our investment in critical capabilities.	8	36	41	1	4835
senrobportman	Wishing the @CleGuardians all the best today in Game 5 against that team from the Bronx! #ForTheLand	4	12	24	1	129
senrobportman	The war crimes committed by Vladimir Putin and his military are reprehensible and Russia should be held accountable. #Ukraine has the right to defend itself against this unjustified invasion and the U.S. and the entire free world must not let up in our support now.	5	27	38	2	2300
senrobportman	Last week, I called for the United States and our allies to provide additional security aid, specifically air defense systems, to help #Ukraine defend itself against these unjustified attacks on civilians far from the frontlines.	5	53	38	4	2301
senrobportman	American families need common-sense economic policies that Republicans had in place prior to the pandemic that produced record economic growth, higher wages and low inflation.	8	44	17	1	4836
senrobportman	Americans have seen every aspect of their cost of living rise. Necessities like energy, food, and rent have become unaffordable for many families, wages haven’t kept up, and pensions and 401(k) plans have been diminished.	8	18	16	0	4837
senrobportman	Unfortunately, the increased inflation rates the Biden admin called “transitory” show no signs of slowing, and middle-class families are feeling the consequences. Americans are experiencing nearly 40 year high inflation everywhere.	44	221	153	4	6716
SenSherrodBrown	Tonight, the Senate took a critical step toward passing the Respect for Marriage Act to protect the rights of all Ohioans to marry who they choose.I’m proud to be one of only seven current Senators who voted AGAINST the Defense of Marriage Act over 25 years ago. #LoveisLove	110	41	1390	7	3634

JimInhofe	I’m pleased that @USGAO confirmed what I’ve known from the start – the EPA’s decision to punish small refineries was unjust and based on bad economics.

JimInhofe	Many of our @NATO allies on the front lines with Russia give more aid to Ukraine pound-for-pound than the U.S. That's why we need to ramp up industrial capacity to refill our own weapons stocks, sell to allies to refill their own and sustain Ukraine victories.	257	138	1656	41	2340
JimInhofe	For nearly two years, @USEnvoyIran @Rob_Malley offered Iran massive sanctions relief to re-enter the failed 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which ignores Iran's terrorism and drone program. That approach failed miserably – Iran is now helping Russia kill Ukrainians.	460	141	1025	29	2341

JimInhofe	I don’t remember one time that we were in disagreement with each other. But more importantly, we became close friends and remained so until the day of his passing—we have lost a good Oklahoman and a great man today…and a brother.	3	6	15	0	4858

JimInhofe	The border crisis that Biden has allowed hurts American citizens, hurts our law enforcement and it even hurts the ones who have been encouraged to take the dangerous and illegal journey to cross our border.	21	120	132	3	4859
JimInhofe	Instead of working on bipartisan solutions, Democrats have pushed far-left spending proposals that are full of poison pills. These are a non-starter for Republicans, which is why we find ourselves dealing with yet another short-term bill.	4	19	17	0	4860
JimInhofe	I couldn’t agree more, @TomColeOK04. Once again, Pres. Biden showcases how out of touch he is with the needs of Americans.	4	14	15	0	4861
JimInhofe	Over the last two years, fentanyl has flown across our southern border at record highs, fueling a drug overdose crisis in our nation. This started and grew because of the border crisis, yet President Biden still does not take action.	7	15	23	3	6721
JimInhofe	Democrats have now increased the IRS budget by $80 billion, a move that is clearly aimed at extracting more money out of hard-working Americans. Instead of targeting middle-class Americans, we should focus on turning the economy around so Americans can take home a better paycheck	31	106	138	11	4862
JimInhofe	The Biden administration's student debt bailout encourages colleges to raise the cost of tuition, making it even harder for working Americans to get an education past high school, and only increasing the burden of student debt down the road.	31	122	125	6	4863
JimInhofe	Since President Biden took office, Americans are paying 13.2% more than they did before  – thanks to Democrats’ reckless decisions. Republicans are working to rein in spending and get our economy back on track.	41	127	136	6	4864

JimInhofe	Since Biden took office, inflation has risen to cost Oklahomans an extra $590 on monthly household spending. The admin’s celebration of “inflation reduction” is an insult to Americans who are struggling to pay bills due to Democrats’ own missteps.	16	18	28	0	4866
JimInhofe	There are two things we should be doing here in Congress: defending America and supporting our nation’s infrastructure. I'm proud to join my colleagues in introducing legislation that would do just that ⬇	3	12	8	1	2345
JimInhofe	The fact that Pres. Biden is touting the so-called “Inflation Reduction Act” today as a win for the U.S. economy is further proof of how disconnected he is from the American people. Inflation remains at record highs &amp; Oklahomans &amp; Americans are suffering every day because of it.	9	41	21	1	2346
JimInhofe	Our National Defense Strategy is not shy about the scope &amp;scale of the threat from China, &amp;the speed of their advances. There’s no better example of that than space. In a decade, the U.S. has gone from the unquestioned leader in space to merely one of two peers in a competition.	3	9	10	1	2347
JimInhofe	Instead of working to address this problem, Democrats are focused on pursuing their far-left agenda that will only increase inflation and harm everyday Americans. Our law enforcement agencies need our support.	1	12	7	1	4867

JimInhofe	The bipartisan #FY23NDAA is a necessary bill that equips our nation’s military amid growing threats. @SenSchumer can't wait until November to bring the NDAA to the Senate floor like last year - there's too many important national security amendments that need consideration now.	2	19	9	0	3649

JimInhofe	It's clear that Congress will have a lot of work to do to improve a Ukraine aid package when we return. The American people deserve a military aid strategy that protects U.S. national interests by helping the Ukrainians end this war quickly. 4/4.	1	10	8	0	2348
JimInhofe	Simultaneously, the White House has done little to incentivize or enable NATO countries to contribute more. And the White House has used the Defense Production Act for just about everything except the production of munitions. 3/4	1	3	6	0	5918
JimInhofe	At every step of the way, this White House poured cold water on innovative ideas from Congress, DOD and the State Department on how best to aid Ukraine. This applies to not only the pace of aid, but also crucial capabilities like ATACMS and medium-size drones. 2/4	1	7	3	0	2349
JimInhofe	This aid package is insufficient to provide the Ukrainians with what they need to win. The Biden admin is now explicitly arguing to provide Ukraine with less military aid than Congress gave them several months ago in a massive bipartisan vote. Congress will have to lead again.1/4	2	28	14	2	2350

JimInhofe	Again: Republicans will resist President Biden's shorter and weaker Iran deal, if he agrees to it. But also remember: Republicans repeatedly offered the President a bipartisan approach. Sadly, President Biden ignored our overtures, and broke his promise.	25	11	51	1	2353
JimInhofe	"Finally, in Mar 2022, 49 R senators wrote: ""We would be willing &amp; eager to support an Iran policy that completely blocks Iran’s path to a nuclear weapons capability, constrains Iran’s ballistic missile program &amp; confronts Iran’s support for terrorism.” ↓"	16	7	35	1	2354
JimInhofe	Then, along with the other four Republican leaders of the national security committees, I wrote a letter to President Biden urging him to seek bipartisan congressional support for US policy on Iran, and laid out principles that would win that support ↓	14	4	29	0	2355
JimInhofe	Short version: Rs could support a comprehensive (addresses Iran's terror, nuke program, and missiles), inclusive (of Israel &amp; our Arab partners), permanent (no sunsets) &amp; transparent (stronger inspections) deal. I also said it on the Senate floor ↓	15	6	29	3	2356
JimInhofe	"I wanted to keep them honest. I also wanted to remind them that Republicans had torpedoed the JCPOA before, but could support a ""longer and stronger"" deal that broadly addressed the Iranian threat. Here's what I wrote in @ForeignPolicy in Feb 2021 ↓"	18	6	35	0	4872
JimInhofe	After Biden won, I spoke with many of his incoming senior national security officials. They unanimously echoed this message: President Biden would pursue a deal with Iran, but emphatically — and explicitly — not the Obama one. Sadly, they backtracked almost immediately.	23	6	44	4	2357
JimInhofe	"In 2020, then-candidate Biden promised to ""strengthen and extend the nuclear deal's provisions, while also addressing other issues of concern"" as part of a ""smarter way to be tough on Iran."""	16	3	27	0	2358
JimInhofe	"If President Biden grants the Iranian regime billions in sanctions relief to rejoin a shorter and weaker nuclear deal, Republicans will strongly oppose. But this wasn't inevitable. Biden promised a ""longer and stronger"" deal - and Republicans were willing to play ball. 👇"	76	34	170	11	4873
JimInhofe	The U.S. and our allies and partners must do everything we can to help Ukraine beat back the Russian invaders, and to do more to share the burden of our collective defense and bolster our deterrence of Russia, China and all other threats to the transatlantic community.	1	7	5	1	2359
JimInhofe	The 31st anniversary of Ukraine's independence from the Soviet Union also marks 6 months since Putin ordered his heinous attempt to seize all of Ukraine.

SenatorLankford	The Biden administration is trying to use handouts right before the election to offset their war on American energy.	24	95	103	4	4885
SenatorLankford	After implementing bad energy policies that drove up the cost of energy for all of us, now the White House wants to throw $13 billion in taxpayer aid to people who can’t afford their bad policies. American energy independence is a better answer.	20	66	102	7	4886
SenatorLankford	We cannot ever be dependent on China for EV energy and manufacturing. We need more US manufacturing like this &amp; more US critical mineral development to secure US energy independence &amp; Oklahoma’s all-of-the-above energy strategy as a top-10 renewable producer + oil &amp; gas.	4	11	20	4	2377

SenatorLankford	Today, we remember &amp; honor the legacy of the eleven people who were murdered four years ago while worshipping at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, the deadliest antisemitic attack in the history of the US. Unfortunately, this attack was not an isolated incident.	10	32	48	1	226
SenatorLankford	Biden’s policies have made the US dependent on OPEC+ &amp; foreign countries for oil - so much for US energy independence or energy dominance. Read my op-ed in @DCExaminer here -&gt;	5	54	19	3	2380
SenatorLankford	It’s clear the border remains open &amp; the Biden Admin continues to ignore the chaos when there are real changes that could be made to secure it. It’s absurd that they cannot see the national security crisis they have created. #BidenBorderCrisis	10	44	34	5	5927

SenatorLankford	FBI and DOJ's silence on attacks, harassment,&amp; intimidation against churches &amp;pro-life groups is  alarming--no American should live in fear b/c of their personally held beliefs or be afraid to worship. The FBI &amp; DOJ must investigate &amp; speak out against these continued attacks.	24	152	68	7	4888
SenatorLankford	Instead of criticizing OPEC, Biden should make them irrelevant by increasing domestic energy production	9	40	50	4	5928
SenatorLankford	The president applauded policies that cut American energy production, raised gas prices on Americans and shifted our energy dependency to foreign countries. Now—days before the election—he is using America’s emergency oil stockpile to try to manipulate gas prices.	28	83	67	10	2381

SenatorLankford	Inflation # are out for Sept, prices are up 13.5%! Inflation has been under control for 40yrs until Biden took office &amp; Dems started spending &amp; cutting off US energy supply.

From passing the ACA, to making the “For the People Act” House Democrats’ top priority, your steadfastness to always put the American families and workers first is a lesson in leadership.	59	12	242	3	3654
SenJeffMerkley	I worked with @RepMcEachin and @SenTinaSmith to introduce the Rural Health Equity Act to establish an Office of Rural Health within the CDC. Let's get this done to help address health disparities in our rural communities!	16	3	42	1	5942

SenJeffMerkley	I agree with @ChrisVanHollen, who I worked with to call for a full and transparent investigation into the killing of Shireen Abu Akleh. I am glad to see the U.S. taking this needed step toward accountability.	57	103	186	2	2440
SenJeffMerkley	In the face of an extremist Supreme Court intent on chipping away at our fundamental rights, it’s critical that we codify marriage equality in federal law. We need to pass the Respect for Marriage Act in the Senate and send it to @POTUS’s desk.	95	63	530	3	3656
SenJeffMerkley	One year ago this week, @POTUS signed the bipartisan infrastructure law—a historic investment in our country. From needed repairs to roads and bridges to increased affordable broadband access, this bill is already at work in Oregon—I can’t wait to see what the next year brings.	25	8	116	0	2441
SenJeffMerkley	Democrats have made progress for the people:✅ Passed the PACT Act for our veterans✅ Passed the bipartisan infrastructure law✅ Passed the CHIPS and Science Act to support U.S. manufacturing✅ Passed the Inflation Reduction Act+ more. Let’s keep building on that progress!	42	13	110	1	2442
SenJeffMerkley	The House has already passed the Respect for Marriage Act, which would codify marriage equality in federal law. It’s past time for the Senate to do the same—we need to get this done.	94	26	472	3	3657

SenToomey	Congress’ failure to pass legislation creating regulatory guardrails for crypto trading, combined with the complete hostility and lack of transparency by @SECGov, has generated a debilitating amount of legal uncertainty.	1029	545	4991	88	5949
SenToomey	It seems FTX’s foreign exchange was acting in ways that put customer funds at significant risk.Given that traditional financial exchanges generally operate much differently, I imagine many FTX customers were not well informed (if at all) about the firm’s debatable actions.	75	100	637	20	5950

SenToomey	While the Fed has finally woken up to the inflation reality, it's going to take both fiscal and monetary policy to ease the daily inflation tax on Americans. Yet the Biden administration is throwing more fuel on the fire, most recently with its student loan forgiveness plan.	5	12	26	0	4925

These courageous men and women were helping Americans &amp; our allies safely evacuate when a terrorist attacked the Hamid Karzai Intl Airport. We will never forget their sacrifice.	13	30	62	1	2482
SenToomey	This decision will have wide-reaching, negative ramifications across America’s economy, including increasing already disastrous inflation, exacerbating America’s spending problems, and encouraging higher education institutions to raise the cost of going to college.	6	64	48	3	2483
SenToomey	Taxpayers will foot the bill for this massive expenditure, including the vast majority of Americans who already paid off their loans, paid for tuition out of pocket, or do not even have post-secondary education nor enjoy the higher lifetime earnings associated with it.	42	125	162	10	4937
SenToomey	President Biden’s student loan bailout scheme is a government handout to Americans making up to $250K annually &amp; the higher education industrial complex.	13	134	74	5	4938

SenToomey	With inflation skyrocketing, gas prices at near-record highs, and our economy likely in a recession, the last thing Americans need are more corporate welfare, higher taxes, and more government spending.	12	90	43	5	4939
SenToomey	And contrary to the bill’s name, non-partisan analysts have confirmed that it does nothing to alleviate the inflation tax Americans are feeling every day.	33	59	121	4	4940
SenToomey	To fund new ‘green’ corporate welfare and give Obamacare subsidies to wealthy Americans, this legislation forces short-sighted tax hikes on American businesses and imposes innovation-crippling price controls on life-saving medicines.	11	27	32	3	4941
SenToomey	Last year, Democrats jammed through trillions of dollars in reckless spending that fueled the worst inflation in 40 years.

SenWhitehouse	Looking at the two together, it appears that Republicans dominated Democrats in outside/dark money $885M (685 + 200) to $575M (480 + 95), a $310 million spending advantage for Republicans.	121	9	360	3	4954
SenWhitehouse	Amid all the close-fought AZ election battles, voters came out better than 2-1 — despite a barrage of dark-money opposition — to vote an end to dark money in their elections. Shows how much voters hate this crap. It’s corrupting, and voters know it.	389	29	1068	11	2512
SenWhitehouse	The record supporting such actions is ready-made from impeachment and 1/6 committee work. Moreover, in civil matters Trump can be called to testify under oath, and if he asserts his Fifth Amendment rights, the court can draw an “adverse inference” against him.	745	33	3734	8	6755
SenWhitehouse	Something to consider: there is the prospect of litigation in every state in which Trump files, based on lawsuits to disqualify him via the Fourteenth Amendment bar on insurrectionists running for office.	5991	842	20852	257	6756

SenWhitehouse	"U.S.S. Rhode Island is in the Med, reported by the US Navy:  ""The USS Rhode Island (SSBN 740) has arrived in Gibraltar for a scheduled port visit on November 1, 2022."""	26	5	158	1	2518
SenWhitehouse	When things go wrong — photographs from the climate frontiers. Republicans won’t help because fossil fuel money funds the party.	188	15	307	8	4960
SenWhitehouse	And one billion dollars in dark money dropped into Republican Senate races this election bodes ill.  Money talks; dark money demands.	221	25	633	5	4961
SenWhitehouse	Nice idea, but on climate Republicans listen to big donors (Big Oil) not voters. We’re not holding them back; no Republican has gotten on a serious climate bill since Citizens United corrupted politics.	474	39	1235	9	4962
SenWhitehouse	Tuesday voting will be driven by one billion dollars in dark money for Republican Senate candidates. That’s not democracy. Let’s pass DISCLOSE and stop this corruption.	4988	1147	12717	150	4963
SenWhitehouse	The outdated ritual of ‘falling back’ disrupts our daily routine and darkens our lives – in a very literal sense.  The Senate has already passed our bipartisan bill to make Daylight Saving Time permanent nationwide. We should get this bill to the President’s desk.	2876	1323	12797	272	5995
SenWhitehouse	My DISCLOSE Act would shine a light on dark money. Republicans blocked the bill in September, but I will never stop fighting for disclosure.Americans have a right to know who is pouring so much money into swaying their vote.	1038	64	2735	34	4964
LindseyGrahamSC	If you’re frustrated at times with the way we do business in Washington — saying one thing and doing another — I agree.	78	909	656	43	2519

LindseyGrahamSC	I hope the House GOP will quickly pass a strong border security bill.	58	183	539	8	5996
LindseyGrahamSC	Democrats expect Republicans to embrace legalization.  However, we must fix the border first. To do otherwise just encourages an even greater run on the US border.  It’s beyond throwing gas on an already raging immigration fire.	52	134	401	10	2521
LindseyGrahamSC	The ink is not even dry on the 2022 midterms and Senator Schumer declared that a massive immigration bill should be the first order of business.  How tone deaf can you be?	92	588	568	36	6761
LindseyGrahamSC	Speaking with @JesseBWatters at 7:00 pm about the latest on Capitol Hill and why I support @HerschelWalker in the upcoming Georgia Senate runoff.  Tune in!	36	548	315	19	2522
LindseyGrahamSC	The refusal to adopt Senator Lee’s amendment, which clearly protects religious institutions from reprisals, says all I need to know about the potential risks of the bill to religious liberty.	185	612	1870	38	6762
LindseyGrahamSC	I just voted against the “Respect for Marriage Act” that is supposed to protect gay marriage without creating risks to religious freedom and religious institutions.	673	8518	7552	832	3676
LindseyGrahamSC	Congratulations to Senator McConnell on his reelection as Senate Minority Leader.	80	3039	1131	200	5997
LindseyGrahamSC	As we listen to President Trump remind us of what is possible regarding our borders, economy, and national security, it is my hope that he will continue to focus on the solutions that he offered tonight to restore a broken America.	433	3443	4176	169	2523
LindseyGrahamSC	If President Trump continues this tone and delivers this message on a consistent basis, he will be hard to beat.  His speech tonight, contrasting his policies and results against the Biden Administration, charts a winning path for him in the primaries and general election.	4277	31970	39699	3533	5998
LindseyGrahamSC	If the facts are borne out to be correct that Russian missiles did hit Poland and kill two people, a firm response by NATO will be absolutely indispensable for world order.	32	200	283	26	2524
LindseyGrahamSC	How NATO responds to this incident will be one of the most consequential decisions by NATO since its founding. We cannot let Putin believe he has a green light to continue to commit war crimes against Ukraine and jeopardize the stability of Europe.	37	97	290	8	2525
LindseyGrahamSC	Very important that we fully understand the facts regarding reports that Russian missiles landed in Poland. Putin’s aggression against Ukraine will not be confined to Ukraine — the sooner everyone in the world understands that, the better.	73	442	612	32	2526
LindseyGrahamSC	I expect a vote tomorrow in the Senate Republican Conference on whether we should delay leadership elections until after Georgia.  I will also be part of making that motion.	8	26	59	2	2527
LindseyGrahamSC	I fall in the camp of believing we should focus on Georgia before we have leadership elections in the Senate.  The same goes for those who aspire to be President in 2024.	14	39	84	9	2528
LindseyGrahamSC	Simply put, re-electing Warnock would be the equivalent of giving New York three senators. Not good for Georgia.	73	519	645	18	2529
LindseyGrahamSC	Senator Schumer – a liberal Democrat from New York – stated that he believes Senator Warnock is a better fit for Georgia.  If you’re a liberal Democrat from New York, that would be a logical conclusion.	59	778	426	34	2530
LindseyGrahamSC	One of the takeaways from 2022 midterms: ▶️  On the GOP side, the 2020 election should finally be over.	187	3174	2384	291	5999
LindseyGrahamSC	@tedcruz @HerschelWalker All Republicans should be focused on winning in Georgia and trying to understand the midterm elections before Senate leadership elections or moving on to the 2024 presidential race.	170	1132	1543	72	2531
LindseyGrahamSC	In light of #GASen runoff, it would be appropriate to delay Senate leadership elections until we know who is in the Senate Republican Conference.  I totally agree with Senator @TedCruz that to do otherwise would be disrespectful to @HerschelWalker.	1195	9065	9680	783	6000
LindseyGrahamSC	It was an honor to speak today with WWII veteran Barbara Alderson of Chester County who turns 100 this week. Thank you for your service to our nation!	23	378	237	11	151

LindseyGrahamSC	▶️ Biden Administration will not change course on inflation, crime, or the border.  As to GOP hopes for retaking the White House in 2024 — best bet is 'Run Joe Run.'	30	362	341	14	230
LindseyGrahamSC	▶️ Clear to me that Democrats overperformed but should still fall short in the House.  ▶️ As to the Senate, still possible for a GOP majority with runoff in Georgia.  Also, the 2024 map is great for a GOP Senate.	88	1013	994	48	2533

LindseyGrahamSC	With all due respect, I believe the reason Republicans will win is because Democrats have put America on the Socialist, big government, woke track that our nation is dying to get off of.  When we win, I will do my best to stop the crazy and move the country forward.	86	906	906	46	2537

LindseyGrahamSC	The U.S.-Israel relationship is founded on bedrock principles of shared values and common enemies. I will continue to work in a bipartisan fashion to keep Israel safe and strong as she is a vital ally to the United States.	20	54	186	7	2539
LindseyGrahamSC	After fighting the good fight, Verna Mae is now in the hands of a loving God and reunited with her beloved Hollis. Rest in Peace. Until we all meet again.	16	53	167	1	6764
LindseyGrahamSC	Verna Mae was full of life and never met a stranger. She was loving, caring, and made a positive difference in so many lives. She always made Christmas special for all. We have all lost someone very dear to us, and my Aunt Nell has lost her best friend.	14	27	127	0	6765
LindseyGrahamSC	After our parents died, Verna Mae, Hollis, and my Aunt Nell supported Darline and me in every way possible. We would not have made it without them and so many others.	5	8	38	0	6766
LindseyGrahamSC	Thanks to your generosity tonight –  - hit a homerun for our GOP Senate candidates. 100% of the funds raised will go to these critical races and allow our candidates to finish with a flourish in the last 72 hours.	37	316	238	9	6003

LindseyGrahamSC	I also do not believe the arrogance and condescension we have seen from Mr. Franken will play well with Iowa voters.  He doesn’t have to worry about being the “subordinate” junior senator from Iowa because I don’t think he is ever going to be elected as senator from Iowa!	22	506	150	30	2541
LindseyGrahamSC	➡️ He even was condescending about my thirty years of military service as an Air Force lawyer. Iowa voters are well-served by Senator Grassley, and I expect he will be overwhelmingly reelected.	23	153	157	7	2542
LindseyGrahamSC	➡️  He was offended by the idea that he would be the junior senator to Joni Ernst, who was a mere Lt. Colonel.     ➡️ He suggested the Governor of Iowa, Kim Reynolds, should fly away on a broom.	6	30	42	3	2543
LindseyGrahamSC	Senator Grassley is a humble public servant, the exact opposite of his Democratic opponent.  While I respect Mr. Franken’s service, I find many of his statements to be condescending and beyond the pale.	8	57	52	5	4967
LindseyGrahamSC	The people of Iowa are well served by Senator @ChuckGrassley.  He is a consistent conservative, independent-minded, and a true gentleman.  I am proud to call him a friend and proud to support his reelection to the Senate. #IASen	62	1016	525	68	2544

LindseyGrahamSC	As I stated during the forum, I expect strong bipartisan support and transparent assistance to Ukraine. Also, other nations must do more as well to help Ukraine. Victory for Ukraine!	22	145	157	8	2546
LindseyGrahamSC	The economic and military aid provided by the United States and others has been vital to Ukraine’s success. No domestic problem in America gets better with Putin dismembering Ukraine and being absolved of war crimes and numerous acts of terror.	15	76	150	4	2547
LindseyGrahamSC	After eight months of fighting, the Ukrainians have turned the tide of battle. It is in our national security interest to ensure that Putin’s ambitions to rewrite the map of Europe fail.	5	27	54	1	3783
LindseyGrahamSC	I was honored to be able to participate in the Yale forum with President Zelensky of Ukraine and Senator Blumenthal from Connecticut.	24	344	237	33	2548

LindseyGrahamSC	1: In the eyes of a New York liberal, Warnock is a perfect fit for Georgia. 2: The demeaning of Herschel Walker by liberals continues.	21	233	206	8	2552
LindseyGrahamSC	As I said last night, liberals all over the country fear the candidacy of @HerschelWalker. This hot mic statement by Chuck Schumer tells you all you need to know about the Georgia Senate race.	111	1125	727	47	2553
LindseyGrahamSC	As to @HerschelWalker, he will be the next senator from Georgia. He will be a transformative figure for the Republican Party and the conservative movement.  I can't wait til Election Night when Georgia goes Red.	26	262	292	10	2554
LindseyGrahamSC	All radical Liberals see today is a stereotype.Any person of color who dares to be a conservative Republican is—in their view—defective. My analysis of how the Left is threatened by Herschel has been more than vindicated by the hateful, vicious statements they make about him.	27	197	232	8	4968
LindseyGrahamSC	@HerschelWalker has accomplished much in his life. Everyone knows he was a Heisman winner, National Champion, and a member of the U.S. Olympic team. But many don't know that he is also a mentor for wounded veterans and started and operated multiple small businesses.	5	77	59	5	2555

SenMikeLee	This month I've traveled across our beautiful state, meeting with Utahns to hear their priorities and how I can help them at the federal level.	33	291	313	17	5029
SenMikeLee	Could my proposal reduce the housing shortage in the West?  Yes.  The @JECRepublicans estimates my plan would fill all the needs of many western states while substantially reducing the shortage in others.	10	92	39	10	3785
MittRomney	RT @SenatorRomney: My statement on the Respect for Marriage Act:	4125	0	0	0	3686
MittRomney	Congratulations to @SenMikeLee, @RepJohnCurtis, @RepBurgessOwens, @RepBlakeMoore, and @RepChrisStewart on their election victories! I look forward to continuing our efforts to advance Utah priorities.	39	1349	550	145	2707
MittRomney	The person most responsible for Senate GOP momentum and likely majority: Mitch McConnell. He personally raised the hundreds of millions (!) that evaporated the Dem lead in the swing states. Speaks softly, carries a big stick.	392	8390	3916	1283	5030
MittRomney	Ann &amp; I are deeply saddened by the passing of Honey Alexander. Honey &amp; Lamar’s relationship was a love story for the ages—a partnership in every sense of the word. Our deepest thoughts &amp; prayers are with Lamar, their children, grandchildren &amp; loved ones. May Honey rest in peace.	18	36	315	2	6815
MittRomney	Heartfelt wishes for healing and recovery for Paul Pelosi and for the comforting of his anxious wife, Speaker Pelosi.	1337	4265	24890	480	6816

MittRomney	I offer my condolences to our friends of the Commonwealth and the loved ones of Queen Elizabeth II, including the Royal Family.

MittRomney	I join the world in mourning the loss of a true and everlasting friend of the United States. @AbeShinzo served his country with honor—a visionary leader who did much to strengthen the U.S.—Japan alliance. My heart is with his family and loved ones, and the people of Japan.	150	395	1783	15	2710
MittRomney	Good and evil in stark relief: the demonic Buffalo shooter and the heroic officer Aaron Salter, Jr. who returned fire, making himself a vulnerable target. Voices of hate inspire acts of horror; honor streams from the better angels of our nature.	339	1398	4281	123	2711
MittRomney	Sweden has long-been a security partner to NATO and their decision to seek membership is welcome news. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has underscored the importance of alliances between freedom loving countries to bolster cooperation and security.	159	159	2170	17	2712
MittRomney	This is one reason why every Republican opposed the Democrat $1.9 trillion “American Rescue Plan”—it borrowed to send billions to states like California that were already awash in cash. Wasteful, inflationary, profligate.	202	962	1656	96	2713
MittRomney	Good news that Finland will apply to join NATO—a freedom loving, vigorous people will strengthen the alliance just as the alliance will strengthen Finland.	200	258	3305	31	2714
MittRomney	A million. Tragic. Maybe it’s over, maybe not. But Dems intentionally refusing to allow a vote to buy therapeutics that can save lives—inexcusable.	166	1576	2046	118	5032
MittRomney	Desperate polls call for desperate measures: Dems consider forgiving trillions in student loans. Other bribe suggestions: Forgive auto loans? Forgive credit card debt? Forgive mortgages? And put a wealth tax on the super-rich to pay for it all. What could possibly go wrong?	3536	42455	35013	13629	5033
MittRomney	Christ died and rose from death for all—we are His family, all of us. Of course, profound gratitude, but also profound implications for the way we are to express it: kindness, forgiving, caring, honesty, virtue and love.

We must never forget despite our often deep divisions, we are children of the same God &amp; in the single family of humanity.	588	970	5537	91	2716
MittRomney	Worst domestic news today: the Biden Administration will admit double or more the number of “undocumented” immigrants at the border, starting May 28. Best GOP political news today: the same as above. (Arizona, Nevada, and more Dem senators will lose their elections)	432	6209	3167	989	2717
MittRomney	On day 28 of the brutal Russian invasion, we are in awe of Ukrainian resolve and courage. They can and must win. We and NATO can and must finally send every needful weapon including advanced anti-air missiles and MiGs. Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead.	216	301	1565	17	5034

I watch daily in awe at the monumental courage and leadership of @ZelenskyyUa. God bless him and instill within us such character.	6263	2360	54962	430	6818
MittRomney	I join the world in awe of true heroes: the courageous President Zelensky, the brave Ukrainian soldiers, the citizen armies, the mothers cradling frightened children, and the journalists risking their lives to bring us truth. God bless them and God bless us to never forget.	5367	2456	50863	372	5036
MittRomney	Vladimir Putin’s KGB mentality drives his malevolent obsession for repression and regression: he shamelessly abuses the sovereignty of a democratic nation to foster his foolhardy dream of rebuilding a soviet empire. The response from NATO must be unified and withering.	2429	1510	15487	348	6060
MittRomney	It's nonsensical for the Biden Administration to ask for more money when billions of COVID relief dollars remain unspent. More spending could exacerbate high inflation rates. We must push for full accountability of the money that has already been appropriated to expose waste.	91	400	1002	40	6061
MittRomney	My appreciation for Justice Breyer’s service and scholarship spans decades, from his class on antitrust, which I attended in law school, to his thoroughly reasoned opinions on the bench. SCOTUS will miss such a good and brilliant man.	318	316	6160	45	6062
MittRomney	The Senate voted tonight to preserve the 60 vote, bipartisan approval for legislation, saving the institution itself. Senators Manchin and Sinema demonstrated the courage of their convictions. It was a good and historic night.	352	2444	4440	248	6063
MittRomney	Arrogant dismissal of China’s genocide of the Uyghurs and other minorities by the billionaire venture capitalist who founded the ironically named “Social Capital” fund is repulsive, immoral, and disgusting.	1462	1117	13347	285	2718
MittRomney	Putin invaded Ukraine to take Crimea. Inadequate consequences—including Biden lifting Nord Stream 2 sanctions—beget further aggression. Now is the time for us and our allies to tell Putin precisely what severe consequences will follow further aggression or another invasion.	122	442	836	56	2719
MittRomney	Inflation hits a 40-year high—hurting the middle class and most vulnerable. Just as predicted given Biden and Schumer’s $1.9 trillion spending extravaganza last March—passed without a single GOP vote.	215	2133	1708	183	6064
MittRomney	Mike Rounds speaks truth knowing that our Republic depends upon it. Republicans like Govs Hutchinson, Baker &amp; Hogan; Sens McConnell, Thune &amp; Johnson; Bush &amp; Cheney; plus 60+ courts and even the right-leaning Wall Street Journal editorial page agree: Joe Biden won the election.	11978	7089	62692	1902	5037
MittRomney	They are in fact related—a functioning Senate helps the country function. The Senate actually functions (in 2021, a bipartisan infrastructure bill; bipartisan armed services bill; and bipartisan China bill). Getting 100% of what 1 party wants isn’t “functioning;” it’s destroying.	146	613	1317	59	2720
MittRomney	Heavy heart learning that Johnny Isakson has died. No one welcomed me to the Senate like he did; no one better demonstrated integrity, honesty &amp; kindness. The loss will be felt by the people he served, the veterans he championed &amp; the nation he loved. Rest well, my good friend.	75	85	1537	15	6065

BernieSanders	In my view, it is absurd that Howard Schultz — a guy worth some 3.7 BILLION dollars — is pulling out all the stops to deny decent wages and dignity on the job to the very Starbucks workers who helped him amass his billions. Absurd. Solidarity with the workers. #RedCupRebellion	958	391	4297	38	6071
BernieSanders	Let me congratulate my friend @KarenBassLA on her historic victory to become Mayor of Los Angeles. Karen has the courage to take on powerful special interests and will stand up for the working families of Los Angeles.	428	143	4131	28	2759
BernieSanders	I'm proud to stand with Starbucks workers on strike today across the country. CEO Howard Schultz is illegally union busting and firing workers for organizing. Mr. Schultz, it is time to recognize the stores that unionized and negotiate with workers in good faith. #RedCupRebellion	2323	906	14203	176	6072

BernieSanders	Congratulations to @MaxwellFrostFL on his historic victory in Florida’s 10th District. Maxwell will be the first member of Gen Z — by far the most progressive generation in this country —elected to Congress. I look forward to working alongside him in Washington.	763	52	9195	46	2761
BernieSanders	Congratulations to @ValHoyle on her win in Oregon last night. Val knows what it means to stand up for working people and fight for raising the minimum wage, passing paid sick leave, and for workers' rights. I very much look forward to working with her in Washington.	342	18	4913	9	2762

BernieSanders	Progressive candidates had a great election night. I want to thank everyone who got out there and helped make this happen. There will now be more strong progressives in the U.S. House than ever before. I’d like to quickly highlight a few of them.	3118	605	39733	175	6073

BernieSanders	FOUR DAYS TO GO: On issue after issue, the Republican Party has nothing to offer the working class. But if we stand together we can create a government that works for all. Join our rally from Oshkosh, Wisconsin.	244	169	1039	13	2775
BernieSanders	Let me thank the more than 400 people, mostly UAW members from Local 578, who came out this morning in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. We are seeing some tremendous energy on the ground in Wisconsin for an agenda that speaks to the working class. THANK YOU OSHKOSH!	230	89	1673	15	2776
BernieSanders	In Wisconsin, the choice on the ballot is pretty clear. Let me tell you about Ron Johnson and the Republican agenda.	634	294	2008	40	2777
BernieSanders	What is the Republican plan to deal with inflation? Anybody got a clue? It's to repeal the estate tax and give nearly $2 TRILLION in tax breaks to the top one-tenth of one percent! And how much would that help the other 99.9% of the country? Not. One. Bit.	2088	2491	7780	175	5058
BernieSanders	THANK YOU to the more than 1,000 people who joined us tonight in Madison, Wisconsin. The billionaires have the money. We've got the people. Let's go forward in the days ahead and let's elect progressives all over this country.	434	244	2669	37	2778

BernieSanders	What this moment in American political life is about is which way we will go. Do we rip each other apart? Do we have working class people fighting with each other? Or do we stand together?	326	173	1195	23	5059
BernieSanders	"At a time of incredible income and wealth inequality, when the top 1% has built a political and economic system that only benefits them, @TishJames has boldly stood up for the working families of New York and said, ""Enough is enough.""

BernieSanders	THANK YOU to the more than 600 people who came out this afternoon in Eau Claire! It was an excellent way to start the final weekend campaigning before this important midterm election. I say, especially to young people, it is absolutely critical that you vote.	159	49	895	10	2782

BernieSanders	A message to my Republican colleagues: No. You don’t reduce inflation by giving tax breaks to billionaires and cutting benefits for the elderly, the sick, the children and the poor. You combat inflation by taking on corporate greed.	1350	1310	4845	131	5060
BernieSanders	I’m proud to endorse @mercedes4nevada to represent Nevada’s 2nd congressional district. She understands that to win rural voters in Nevada and around the country, we need to stand boldly against corporate greed that is increasingly making the lives of working people harder.	183	72	855	10	2785

BernieSanders	Before the midterms, we must do all that we can do to make sure we have a HUGE voter turnout. This Saturday, I am heading to Michigan to rally with voters to do just that.Join us there:	250	138	1049	17	2789
BernieSanders	The billionaires who fund AIPAC are spending $1 million against @SummerForPA because she stands with working people and against corporate greed. Democrats must unite and condemn this Super PAC, and do everything possible to elect Summer.	895	342	3571	53	5061

BernieSanders	"You hear Republicans say it, ""OHHHH Bernie Sanders is an extremist!"" REALLY? You want to know what extremism is? The Republican agenda to give tax breaks to billionaires and cut Social Security. THAT is extremism."	1655	904	6973	97	5062

BernieSanders	When we talk about inflation, here’s the ugly truth. According to a recent study, corporate greed accounts for nearly 54% of the enormous rise in prices Americans are paying for gas, food, groceries and virtually everything else in society. Yeah, we need a windfall profits tax.	1692	1357	6311	134	5063

BernieSanders	A LOS ANGELES FOR WORKING FAMILIES: We must elect leaders who will stand up and take on the big money interests and build a government which puts working families first. Join me and @KarenBassLA as we rally in Los Angeles.	217	81	776	15	2804
BernieSanders	The Republicans have made it clear, from Mitch McConnell on down, that they want to repeal the estate tax, which mean’s Elon Musk’s family, worth over $200 billion, would get a tax break of up to $83 billion. That is obscene.	3112	4098	12252	309	5068
BernieSanders	THANK YOU to everyone who joined us today in Portland, Oregon to get out the vote. With just 12 days to go, we must do everything we can to elect progressives up and down the ballot.	216	108	1229	15	2805
BernieSanders	THANK YOU to the 3,000+ people who joined us today in Eugene, Oregon! If we come out and vote in HUGE numbers in these midterm elections, make no mistake — YES — we can take on the billionaire class and the forces of corporate greed to finally build an economy for all.	312	187	1540	38	2806
BernieSanders	Here is the Republican plan to deal with inflation: Cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid and give billionaires a tax break of up to $1.75 trillion by completely repealing the estate tax – which only benefits the top 0.1% who inherit over $25 million in wealth.	1439	738	3977	91	5069
BernieSanders	LIVE IN OREGON: To take on corporate greed and create an economy for all, we need HUGE voter turnout in Oregon and across the country. Join me, @JeffMerkley, @RonWyden, @DeFazio4Oregon, @ValHoyle &amp; @TinaKotek as we rally ahead of Election Day.	249	122	831	22	2807

BernieSanders	I am proud to endorse @ValHoyle for Congress in Oregon's 4th district. Val knows what it means to stand up for working people and fight for raising the minimum wage, passing paid sick leave, and for workers' rights. I very much look forward to working with her in Washington.	121	64	582	13	2809
BernieSanders	If we have any chance to create an economy that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent, we must expand the Democratic majority in Congress and continue to push them to represent the needs of the working class, not the billionaire class.	530	295	1779	43	5070
MarkWarner	Once again, Ted Cruz is wrong. Especially amid continued violence against LGBT folks, like the tragedy we saw last night in Colorado, it’s time to call out lies about bills attempting to protect LGBT people.	45	19	190	1	2810
MarkWarner	Absolutely every community in Virginia matters to me. This week, I was proud to announce the opening of the Silver Line Extension for NoVa, but also to announce federal funding for projects in Coeburn, Marion, Eastville, Warsaw, and Kilmarnock. More to come.	44	18	332	1	238
MarkWarner	No more chaos. Americans deserve more. We should get the Electoral Count Act done this session and circumvent the potential for uncertainty surrounding the certification of votes &amp; the transition of power.	118	32	565	6	3692
MarkWarner	I’m still thinking about the young people killed in Charlottesville and all they could have done with their lives that we will never get to know. We’ve seen too many tragedies on VA campuses – our gun safety law earlier this year was a good first step, but we need more action.	166	51	1009	7	2811
MarkWarner	A good week’s work – progress on protecting gay and interracial marriage, opening the Silver Line extension, and securing $5 million more to expand broadband across Virginia. More to come!	24	13	191	2	2812
MarkWarner	Had a fun conversation with King George High Schoolers and @RepSpanberger yesterday nerding out about radio waves, TikTok, and tech policy (and got a tough question about my real height)! Made time to crash @SenatorTimScott’s meeting too.	7	4	54	0	6076
MarkWarner	Steny has been a champion for the region and a phenomenal leader for the party. Glad he’ll be staying on in the House, but his decision to step aside and usher in a new generation of leadership is a great vote of confidence in the young leadership of the party.	31	8	263	1	6077
MarkWarner	Speaker Pelosi has delivered on extraordinary legislative priorities – scoring huge wins for Americans on health care, infrastructure, and more. She’s accomplished so much while enduring unbelievably vitriolic attacks. I wish her the best in this new chapter.	94	53	646	4	5071

MarkWarner	My statement with @TimKaine, @RepDonBeyer, and @RepWexton on the five-year anniversary of the death of Bijan Ghaisar.	36	4	104	1	6844
MarkWarner	I strongly support us taking this step and passing the Respect for Marriage Act so couples aren’t in limbo, but it’s clear we need to go farther. Virginia still has a ban on same-sex marriages at the state level, and it’s time to repeal it.	78	18	395	6	2813
MarkWarner	The bill we’re working on passing through the Senate right now is a bipartisan compromise that would make sure gay marriages will always be honored across state lines – but it doesn’t require every state to issue licenses if Obergefell is overruled.	83	41	367	9	6078

MarkWarner	I’m thankful for the hard work of local law enforcement in bringing the suspect of the shooting at UVa into custody.

MarkWarner	With so many things on the ballot – the future of our democracy, women’s healthcare, foreign policy, and the continued existence of programs like Social Security – it’s critical to make your voice heard. Vote today.	28	15	135	5	6080
MarkWarner	Let’s be clear – a nationwide abortion ban is on the ballot. I’ll always do what I can to protect women’s access to health care, but the truth is we need more seats to codify Roe.	106	73	418	6	3693

MarkWarner	This isn’t idle speculation – it’s already under way. In primaries this cycle, three counties in PA and one county in NM refused to certify election results and had to be forced by state court action. I think it’s likely we’ll see more legal tests of how far counties can go.	21	3	119	0	2821

MarkWarner	A couple months ago, I met the famous Linda Skeens – the undisputed queen of the VA-KY State Fair. We did a recipe swap – my tuna melt for her Twinkie Casserole – and I made it and it was delicious! Thank you Linda for making VA proud and for this great recipe!	9	7	69	0	2827
MarkWarner	The cessation of hostilities agreement between the Government of Ethiopia &amp; TPLF is a moment of significance in a process towards peace, stability. Efforts by the AU &amp; negotiators to get here are commendable. The US supports continued progress for the benefit of Ethiopian people	11	6	43	0	2828
MarkWarner	Finally getting the Silver Line Extension done, getting relief for victims of consolidated student loans, and securing federal funding for child care. A few wins of the past few weeks – I’m proud to get things done for Virginians.	48	17	215	2	244
MarkWarner	The continued existence of Social Security is on the ballot. Make a plan to vote.	145	73	457	14	6083
MarkWarner	The truth is, the attack on Paul Pelosi is the awful consequence of increasingly violent political rhetoric. When election deniers, insurrectionists, and calls to violence are given a platform, democracy itself and the lives of political officials are in danger.	80	77	323	5	6848
MarkWarner	Richmond – mark your calendars for this career fair! USPS is also hiring all across the Commonwealth, and this resource has great tips about securing a job.	12	6	32	1	2829
MarkWarner	November is National Diabetes Month. We accomplished something huge this year and capped insulin at $35/month for folks on Medicare – a historic achievement. But Americans are still rationing insulin because of skyrocketing costs. We must get this provision passed FOR ALL.	14	6	66	2	5076
MarkWarner	Families need reliable, affordable child care options. When providers were most uncertain and in danger of closing, the American Rescue Plan funded &amp; stabilized thousands of providers across Virginia so families weren’t left in the lurch.	17	12	63	1	2830
MarkWarner	NEW: The Silver Line Extension will officially open on Nov. 15, extending service across Virginia. I’m so proud to have worked to get this done.	102	45	778	11	2831
MarkWarner	So many folks rely on the @USPS – and I’m so proud we passed a bill earlier this year to modernize some of their processes and keep them afloat financially. But there’s more to do – I’m continuing to monitor delays and advocate for reform where appropriate.	29	31	256	5	6084
MarkWarner	Election Day could be a federal holiday – expanding access to the ballot box for thousands that work long hours or have distant commutes. All we need to do is pass the Freedom to Vote Act. I’m disappointed my Republican colleagues have repeatedly filibustered it.	191	79	850	13	5077
MarkWarner	Just wanted to make sure you saw the news – courtesy of the bipartisan infrastructure law, kids across Virginia are going to get to school in buses that are new, safe, and pollute way less.	85	59	413	7	2832
MarkWarner	I know what a critical resource the Metro is for NoVa, and that’s why I’ve worked to broker a plan for the safe &amp; timely opening of the Silver Line. I’ll stay on top of this until it’s done and will always fight for projects that impact Virginians.	28	20	137	1	245

MarkWarner	Today, we remember the lives lost four years ago at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. We cannot let anti-semitism proliferate in our communities. I stand firmly with Jewish Americans and against hate speech and terror.	69	28	349	2	2835
MarkWarner	Funds from the American Rescue Plan have stabilized 4,970 child care programs across Virginia – allowing them to stay staffed and serve 317,500 children, giving parents the flexibility they need to work. This is critical funding for our kids and for stabilizing our economy.	62	21	281	3	2836
MarkWarner	The great economic threat to the United States is the rise of the Chinese Communist Party. I’m proud to work on initiatives to onshore American jobs so our supply chain is independent and secure.	25	28	129	4	2837
MarkWarner	The rise of Big Tech presents tremendous job and innovation opportunities, but when unregulated it can lead to crushing monopolies, privacy infringement, and more. I’m working in Congress to build a more transparent tech landscape.	21	7	69	1	6085
MarkWarner	Rising costs matter to me – it’s why I worked so hard to get the CHIPS Act passed &amp; deployed so we can ease some of the supply chain snares that have contributed to price increases for so many goods.	22	8	99	0	3694
MarkWarner	After brokering productive discussions with @wmata &amp; @MetrorailSafety, @timkaine and I are pleased to see a plan that will allow the safe &amp; timely opening of the Silver Line to Dulles by Thanksgiving. Look forward to providing oversight over the careful execution of this plan.	18	8	175	5	246

MarkWarner	I’ve been raising the alarm about Huawei for years – I applaud law enforcement and the DOJ for taking this step and I look forward to seeing any investigations against Huawei proceed unimpeded.	61	20	214	6	6087
MarkWarner	Earlier this year, we passed a seismic achievement and capped insulin costs for those on Medicare at $35/month. This will curb insulin rationing and save lives – it’s time to extend this provision to all.	30	9	126	4	6088
MarkWarner	Happy Diwali to all celebrating across Virginia! Wishing you a peaceful holiday celebrating the Festival of Lights!	16	4	81	0	160
